<p>This report is about Michaela Community School (URN:140862) in the Brent Local Authority. The report has been put together using DfE Open Datasets from 2013 to 2023. The aim of the report is to outline some of the underlying statistics for a school that has such performed so well in the English progress 8 performance metric, and through comparisons with other similar providers, shed some light on the model that Michaela Community School uses to achieve such extraordinary results.</p>

<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Limitations</h1>
<p>The below doesn’t double code Double GCSEs, instead, it currently treats them as a <em>single</em> GCSE entry. The data this report is based off comes from the open DfE datasets, and this report is a trial run for testing these datasets. The DfE datasets are very messy and some mistakes might have slipped through. Errors are likely mine, please get in contact if you have any questions or corrections.</p>

<p>Michaela Community School’s 2023 <a href="https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50222824">Ofsted report</a> states that “They plan a broad and exceptionally rich curriculum, which prepares pupils exceptionally well for the next steps in education”; the <a href="https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/2699471">2017 report</a> says, similarly: “The curriculum ensures that pupils develop their knowledge and understanding across a broad and balanced range of subjects”.</p>
<section id="all-exam-subjects" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="all-exam-subjects"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> All exam subjects</h2>
<p>From the perspective of exam subjects, the exam subject offering at Michaela is far lower than nearly all other comparable schools, i.e.&nbsp;schools of similar size which currently hold an “Outstanding” Oftsed grade. There is only one exception in the data, with Energy Coast UTC, in 2022, having a smaller offering, likely to be made up of vocational qualifications.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that Michaela Community School doesn’t offer a broad curriculum in other ways, for example through cross curricula teaching, extra curricula activities, non-examined and KS3 offerings. But it does highlight that the school’s approach is unorthodox.</p>
