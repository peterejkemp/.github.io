<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“‘Quantitative’ and ‘qualitative’ are frequently seen in opposition…. The contrast is drawn between the objective world (out there independently of our thinking about it) and the subjective worlds (in our heads, as it were, and individually constructed); between the public discourse and private meanings; between reality unconstructed by anyone and the ‘multiple realities’ constructed by each individual. The tendency to dichotomise in this way is understandable but misleading.” <span class="citation" data-cites="pring2000">(<a href="#ref-pring2000" role="doc-biblioref">Pring 2000, 248</a>)</span></p>

<p>This short course aims to take you through the process of writing your first programs in the <strong>R statistical programming language</strong> to analyse national and international educational datasets. To do this we will be using the <strong>R Studio</strong> integrated development environment (IDE), a desktop application to support you in writing R scripts. R Studio supports your programming by flagging up errors in your code as you write it, and helping you manage your analysis environment by giving you quick access to tables, objects and graphs as you develop them. In addition, we will be looking at data analysis using the <strong>tidyverse</strong> code packages. The tidyverse is a standardised collection of supporting code that helps you read data, tidy it into a usable format, analyse it and present your findings.</p>
<p>The R programming language offers similar functionality to an application based statistical tool such as SPSS, with more of a focus on you writing code to solve your problems, rather than using prebuilt tools. R is open source, meaning that it is free to use and that lots of people have written code in R that they have shared with others. R statistical libraries are some of the most comprehensive in existence. R is popular<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in academia and industry, being used for everything from sales modelling to cancer detection.</p>

<p>Whilst it is possible to use R through menu systems and drop down tools, the focus of this course is for you to write your own R scripts. These are text files that will tell the computer how to go through the process of loading, cleaning, analysing and presenting data. The sequential and modular nature of these files makes it very easy to develop and test each stage separately, reuse code in the future, and share with others.</p>
<p>This booklet is written with the following sections to support you:</p>

<p>In programming languages we can attach data to a name, this is called assigning a value to an object (you might also call them <em>variables</em>). To do this in R we use the <code>&lt;-</code> arrow command. For example, I want to put the word <code>"Pete"</code> into an object called <code>myname</code> (note that words and sentences such as <code>"Pete"</code> need speech marks):</p>

<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<ul>
<li>line 1 sets <code>a</code> to equal 2000 (note: don’t use commas in writing numbers <code>a &lt;- 2,000</code> would bring up an error),</li>
<li>line 2 sets <code>b</code> to equal 5,</li>

<span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Naming objects</h3>
<p>Correctly naming objects is very important. You can give an object almost any name, but there are a few rules to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name them something sensible</li>
<li>R is case sensitive, <code>myName</code> is not equal to (<code>!=</code>) <code>myname</code>
</li>
<li>Don’t use spaces in names</li>
<li>Don’t start a name with a number</li>
<li>Keep punctuation in object names to underscore (<code>_</code> and full stop <code>.</code>) e.g.&nbsp;<code>my_name</code>, <code>my.name</code><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Stick to a convention for all your objects, it’ll make your code easier to read, e.g.
<ul>
<li>
<code>myName</code>, <code>yourName</code>, <code>ourName</code> (this is <em>camelCase</em>[^2])</li>
<li>
<code>my_name</code>, <code>your_name</code>, <code>our_name</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are actually three datatypes for numbers in R, <code>numeric</code> for most of your work, the rarer <code>integer</code> specifically for whole numbers and the even rarer <code>complex</code> for complex numbers. When you are looking at categorical data, <code>factors</code> are used on top of the underlying datatype to store the different values, for example you might have a field of <code>character</code> to store <code>countries</code>, factors would then list the different countries stored in this character field.</p>
<p>To change from one datatype to another we use the <code>as.____</code> command: <code>as.numeric(&lt;text&gt;)</code>, <code>as.logical(&lt;data&gt;)</code>, <code>as.character(&lt;numeric&gt;)</code>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Vectors</h3>
<p>So far we have seen how R does simple calculations and prints out the results. Underlying all of this are <em>vectors</em>. Vectors are data structures that bring together one or data elements of the <em>same</em> datatype. E.g. we might have a <code>numeric</code> vector recording the grades of a class, or a <code>character</code> vector storing the gender of a set of students. To define a vector we use <code>c(&lt;item&gt;, &lt;item&gt;, ...)</code>, where <code>c</code> stands for <em>combine</em>. Vectors are very important to R<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, even declaring a single object, <code>x &lt;- 6</code>, is creating a vector of size one. Larger vectors look like this:</p>

<p>You should be careful when trying to compare vectors of different lengths. When combining vectors of different lengths, the shorter vector will match the length of the longer vector by wrapping its values around. For example if we try to combine a vector of the numbers 1 ot 10 with a two item logical vector <code>TRUE</code> <code>FALSE</code>, the logical vector will repeat 5 times: <code>c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)</code>. We can use this vector as a <em>mask</em> to return the odd numbers, TRUE means keep, FALSE means ignore:</p>

<p>There are several shortcuts that you can take when creating vectors. Instead of writing a whole sequence of numbers by hand, you can use the <code>seq(&lt;start&gt;, &lt;finish&gt;, &lt;step&gt;)</code> command. For example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb60-1"><a href="#cb60-1"></a><span class="co"># the step default is 1, so you can miss it from seq(1,10,1)</span></span>
<span id="cb60-2"><a href="#cb60-2"></a><span class="fu">seq</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>,<span class="dv">10</span>)   <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">6</span>,<span class="dv">7</span>,<span class="dv">8</span>,<span class="dv">9</span>,<span class="dv">10</span>)</span>
<span id="cb60-3"><a href="#cb60-3"></a><span class="fu">seq</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>,<span class="dv">10</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>) <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">7</span>,<span class="dv">9</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This allows for some pretty short ways of solving quite complex problems, for example if you wanted to know the sum of all the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000</a>, you could write it like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb61"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb61-1"><a href="#cb61-1"></a><span class="co"># the unique() command gives you the unique items in a vector</span></span>
<span id="cb61-2"><a href="#cb61-2"></a><span class="fu">sum</span>(<span class="fu">unique</span>(<span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="fu">seq</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">999</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>), <span class="fu">seq</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">999</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>))))</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Another shortcut is writing <code>T</code>, <code>F</code>, or <code>1</code>, <code>0</code> instead of the whole words <code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb62"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb62-1"><a href="#cb62-1"></a><span class="fu">c</span>(T, F) <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="cn">TRUE</span>, <span class="cn">FALSE</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

<p>R comes with some excellent statistical tools, but often you will need to supplement them with packages<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> . Packages contain functionality that isn’t built into R by default, but you can choose to load or install them to meet the needs of your tasks. For example you have code packages to deal with SPSS data, and other packages to run machine learning algorithms. Nearly all R packages are free to use!</p>
<section id="installing-and-loading-packages" class="level3" data-number="2.5.1"><h3 data-number="2.5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-and-loading-packages">
<span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Installing and loading packages</h3>
<p>To install a package you can use the package tab in the bottom right-hand panel of RStudio and follow the steps from <a href="#sec-packages">Section&nbsp;2.2.3</a>. Alternatively you can install things by typing:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb71"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb71-1"><a href="#cb71-1"></a><span class="fu">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">"tidyverse"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the instruction is to install package<strong>s</strong>, you can pass a vector of package names to install multiple packages at the same time:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb72"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb72-1"><a href="#cb72-1"></a><span class="fu">install.packages</span>(<span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">"tidyverse"</span>,<span class="st">"readxl"</span>,<span class="st">"haven"</span>))</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once a package is installed it doesn’t mean that you can use it, yet. You will need to <em>load</em> the package. To do this you need to use the <code>library(&lt;package_name&gt;)</code> command, for example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb73"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb73-1"><a href="#cb73-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tidyverse)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

<span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> The tidyverse</h2>
<p>This course focuses on using the <em>tidyverse</em>; a free collection of programming <em>packages</em> that will allow you to write code that imports data, tidys it, transforms it into useful datasets, visualises findings, creates statistical models and communicates findings to others data using a standardised set of commands.</p>

</div>
<p>For many people the tidyverse is the main reason that they use R. The tidyverse is used widely in government, academia, NGOs and industry, notable examples include the <a href="https://johnburnmurdoch.github.io/slides/r-ggplot/#/">Financial Times</a> and the <a href="https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/">BBC</a>. Code in the tidyverse can be (relatively) easily understood by others and <em>you</em>, when you come back to a project after several months.</p>

<p>We can’t do much with R without loading data from elsewhere. Data will come in many formats and R should be able to deal with all of them. Some of the datasets you access will be a few rows and columns; others, like the ones we are going to use on this course, might run into hundreds of thousands or even millions of rows and hundreds or thousands of columns. Depending on the format you are using, you might need to use specific packages. A few of the data file types you might meet are described below:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 22%">
<col style="width: 77%">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>File type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Comma separated values [.csv]</td>
<td>As it says in the name, CSV files store data by separating data items with commas. They are a common way of transferring data and can be easily created and read by Excel, Google spreadsheets and text editors (in addition to R). CSVs aren’t compressed so will generally be larger than other file types. They don’t store information on the types of data stored in the file so you might find yourself having to specify that a date column is a date, rather than a string of text. You can read and write csv files without the need to load any packages, but if you do use <code>readr</code> you might find things go much faster.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Excel [.xls | .xlsx | .xlsxm]</td>
<td>Excel files store data in a compressed custom format. This means files will generally be smaller than CSVs and will also contain information on the types of data stored in different columns. R can read and write these files using the <code>openxlsx</code> package, the tidyverse’s <code>readxl</code> is great for reading, but won’t write for you.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>R Data [.rds]</td>
<td>R has it’s own data format, .rds. Saving to this format means that you will make perfect copies of your R data, including data types and factors. When you load rds files they will look exactly the same as when you saved them. Data can be highly compressed and it’s one of the fastest formats for getting data into R. You can read and write rds files without the need to load any packages, but using the functions in <code>readr</code> might speed things up a bit. You won’t be able to look at .rds files in other programs such as excel</td>

<td>SPSS [.sav]</td>
<td>SPSS is a common analysis tool in the world of social science. The native format for SPSS data is .sav. These files are compressed and include information on column labels and column datatypes. You will need either the <code>haven</code> or <code>foreign</code> packages to read data into R. Once you have loaded the .sav you will probably want to convert the data into a format that is more suitable for R, normally this will involve converting columns into factors. We cover <em>factors</em> in more detail below.</td>

<p>Loading datasets into R will normally store them as <em>dataframes</em> (also known as <em>tibbles</em> when using the tidyverse). Dataframes are the equivalent of tables in a spreadsheet, with rows, columns and datatypes. First we need to get some data into R so we can start analysing them.</p>

<p>Downloading files directly from web addresses can be slow and you might want to prefer to use files saved to your computer’s hard drive. You can do this by following the steps below:</p>
<p>Download the <code>PISA_student_2018.rds</code> file from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tp9xe3dS__eg7RrXf0T_oMxcrz_TbMdM/view">here</a> and save it to your computer where your R code file is.</p>
<p>Copy the location of the file (see next step for help)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To find the location of a file in <strong><em>Windows</em></strong> do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Navigate to the location of the file in <em>Windows Explorer</em>:</p>
<p><img src="images/navigate_file_location.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the address bar</p>
<p><img src="images/select_file_location.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy the location</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To find the location of a file in <strong><em>Mac OSX</em></strong> do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open <em>Finder</em></p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the folder where you saved the Excel file</p></li>
<li>
<p>Right click on the folder where the file is stored and select <code>Copy &lt;name of file&gt; as Pathname</code></p>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To load the data into R we need to use the <code>read_excel(&lt;file_location&gt;, &lt;sheet_name&gt;)</code> command, specifying the location and name of the file we are loading, and as we are reading an Excel file, we need to specify the sheet name within the Excel file.

<p>You might have found that you get an error if you don’t convert your backslashes <code>\</code> into forwardslashes <code>/</code>. It’s common mistake and very annoying. In most programming languages a backslash signifies the start of a special command, for example <code>\n</code> signifies a <code>newline</code>.</p>
<p>With R there are three ways to get around the problem of backslashes in file locations, for the location:<code>"C:\myfolder\"</code> we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace them with forwardslashes (as shown above):<code>"C:/myfolder/"</code>
</li>
<li>replace them with double backslashes (the special character specified by two backslashes is one backslash!):<code>"C:\\myfolder\\"</code>
</li>
<li>use the inbuilt R command to deal with filenames: <code>r"[C:\myfolder\]"</code>

<p>Vectors are data structures that bring together one or more data elements of the same datatype. E.g. we might have a numeric vector recording the grades of a class, or a character vector storing the gender of a set of students. To define a vector we use <code>c(item, item, ...)</code>, where <code>c</code> stands for combine. Vectors are very important to R, even declaring a single object, <code>x &lt;- 6</code>, is creating a vector of size one.

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

<p>Looking at the structure of this column, we can see it is stored as a <code>factor</code>, not as a <code>numeric</code> ::: {.cell}</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Piping</h2>
<p>Piping allows us to break down complex tasks into manageable chunks that can be written and tested one after another. There are several powerful commands in the tidyverse as part of the <em>dplyr</em> package that can help us <code>group</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>mutate</code> and <code>summarise</code> datasets. With this small set of commands we can use piping to convert massive datasets into simple and useful results.</p>
<p>Using the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> command, we can feed the results from one command into the next command making for reusable and easy to read code.</p>

<p>The pipe command we are using <code>%&gt;%</code> is from the <em>magrittr</em> package which is installed alongside the tidyverse. Recently <em>R</em> introduced another pipe <code>|&gt;</code> which offers very similar functionality and tutorials online might use either. The examples below use the <code>%&gt;%</code> pipe.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at an example of using the pipe on the <code>PISA_2018</code> table. If we wanted to know the total number of average maths grades of male and female students in our dataset, we could <code>group_by</code> using <code>ST004D01T</code> (Student Gender) and pass the grouping to a <code>summarise</code> function where we can find the <code>mean</code> of the aggregated maths result <code>PV1MATH</code> and store this as a new column <code>mean_maths</code>. Summarise will drop all the other columns in the table except for the grouping column(s) and the columns calculated in summarise:</p>

<p>Males get a slightly better maths score than Females for this PV score<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. You’ll also notice here that there are students who don’t have any Gender data recorded and they do very poorly compared to males and females. It would be useful to add another column counting the number of students in each Gender grouping. To do this we add another assignment to the <code>summarise</code> command, that counts the number of rows in each grouping using the <code>n()</code> command:</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction to graphing in R</h2>
<p>The tidyverse includes the incredibly powerful <code>ggplot2</code> package. This package is pretty much the industry standard for making graphs for publication. <code>ggplot2</code> is built on the <em>grammar of graphics</em> where you build graphs by specifying underlying attributes and layering geometric objects on top of each other. In the diagram below you can see how a graph is built from <em>geometric objects</em> (the things that are plotted such as points and bars) a <em>scale</em>, and <em>plot annotations</em> (e.g.&nbsp;a key, title etc). You can then apply <em>faceting</em> to the graph to automatically split one graph into multiple plots, allowing you to easily compare different groupings.</p>

</div>
<p>The basic structure of <code>ggplot</code> code is to combine different graphing elements through the use of the <code>+</code> operator. To demonstrate this, let’s look at the relationship between the percentage of males in a school and the percentage of the school taking <code>computer science</code>:</p>

<p>Hopefully you can work out what lines 1-3 do from the previous chapter, let’s focus on the <code>ggplot</code> commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>6-7 these lines set up the <code>ggplot</code> giving it the table object <code>graph_data</code> as its data input and setting up the aesthetics for the rest of the graph elements using columns from <code>graph_data</code>. The <code>aes(&lt;attribute&gt;, &lt;attribute&gt;, ...)</code> command allows us to specify aesthetic elements of the graph that will change dependent on the dataset we use. <code>x=ESCS</code> and <code>y=PV1MATH</code> define the x and y coordinates, defining <code>aes()</code> inside <code>ggplot()</code> means we will pass down these values to subsequent geometric objects so we don’t have to define these <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axis items again and again.</li>
<li>8 using the data and <code>aes</code> values defined on lines 6-7, <code>geom_point</code> uses the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values defined on line 19 to draw a point for each school in our dataset. There are lots of different parameters we could give <code>geom_point</code> e.g.&nbsp;specifying size and shape, but here we are content with using the defaults.</li>
<li>9 we add another geometric object on top of the points, this time we add a line of best fit <code>geom_smooth</code>, again this geometric object uses the values specified on lines 6-7, and we define the <code>method</code> as <code>lm</code>, to calculate a <em>linear model</em> line of best fit.</li>
<li>10 next we use <code>facet_wrap(. ~ CNT)</code> to create a graph for each group of <code>CNT</code> in the dataset, i.e.&nbsp;a graph for each country defined on line 3.</li>
<li>11 finally we customise the title of the graph, <code>ggtitle</code>, ready for display.</li>

<p>Rather unsurprisingly, <code>geom_point</code> allows us to plot a layer of <em>points</em> using x and y coordinates. The below example shows how we can specify within the <code>ggplot</code> function <code>data=school_plot_data</code>. We then define the <code>aes</code>thetic attributes of the graph, passing the x <code>x=NumberOfBoys</code> and y <code>y=NumberOfGirls</code> values.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Recoding data (ifelse)</h3>
<p>Often we want to plot values in groupings that don’t yet exist, for example might want to give all schools over a certain size a different <em>colour</em> from others schools. To do this we need to look at how we can <em>recode</em> values. A common way to recode values is through an if statement:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><code>ifelse(&lt;statement(s)&gt;, &lt;value_if_true&gt;, &lt;value_if_false&gt;)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>ifelse</code> allow us to <em>recode</em> the data. In the example below, we are going to add a new column to the schools table (using <code>mutate</code>) noting whether a school is a <em>grammar</em> school or not. A school is a grammar school <em>if</em> it is not an <em>Independent</em> school <em>and</em> it is <em>selective</em> in its admissions policy, either of these two criteria being false will mean that the school is not a grammar school.</p>
<p>You can see how the above logic is is implemented in an R <code>ifelse</code> statement on lines 4-8.</p>

<ul>
<li>4 uses mutate to create a new column in the schools table called <code>sch_type</code>, this will be given the value of the <code>ifelse</code> statement calculation for each line.</li>
<li>5 - 6 the <code>if</code> statement to be evaluated as either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> has two parts, separated by the ampersand symbol <code>&amp;</code> instead of the word <em>and</em> (as we have seen above, <em>or</em> is implemented using a bar <code>|</code>).</li>
<li>7 “GRAMMAR” will be returned <code>if</code> the statements on line 5 and 6 are both <em>TRUE</em>
</li>
<li>8 “NOT GRAMMAR” will be returned if the combined statements on line 5 and 6 are <em>FALSE</em>, i.e.&nbsp;<em>else</em> the values on line 5 and 6 are true</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, on line 9 we arrange the results, which means you can explore the details of the 163 grammar schools using the Environment panel, how you use arrange also changes the order in which the points will be plotted, allowing you to plot the grammar schools on top of other school types to make them stand out.</p>

<li>2 we define the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> <code>aes</code>theic values here for the <code>geom_point</code>s, we could have done this on line one, but this shows that this can be done separately for each <code>geom_</code>
</li>
<li>3 <code>size</code> is also inside <code>aes()</code> and takes the <code>NumberOfBoys+NumberOfGirls</code> as a parameter, i.e.&nbsp;the population of the school will change the size of the points on the graph</li>
<li>4 <code>colour</code> is also inside <code>aes()</code> and takes the newly coded <code>sch_type</code> values, this means that grammar schools will be a different colour from non-grammar schools</li>
<li>5 to stop the schools blotting each other out, we set the <code>alpha</code> (transparency) of each point to <code>0.4</code>. This is done outside the <code>aes</code> as we want all points to have the same transparency.</li>

<p>The <code>geom_bar</code> function is versatile, allowing the creation of bar, multiple bar, stacked bar charts and histograms.

<!--the `is.na(OfstedRating)` command selects only those rows from _OfstedRating_ that have an `NA` value. By putting the `!` mark in front of this we `NOT` or reverse the result. In this case `!is.na(OfstedRating)` returns all the rows that don't contain `NA` in OfstedRating.-->

<li>8 we pass the <code>plot_schools</code> and <code>x=Region</code> to <code>geom_bar</code>, which counts the number of rows (schools) in each Region and creates a bar of that height.</li>
</ul>
<p>The graph above gives us a feel for the data, but it doesn’t tell us the Ofsted ratings for each Region and the a axis labels are a mess. We need to add a <code>fill</code> to the <code>geom_bar</code> and adjust the <code>theme</code>:</p>

<p>We can now make rough comparisons between the different number of each Ofsted rating. But it remains hard to compare the percentage split. For example the number of <em>Good</em> and <em>Outstanding</em> schools in London is hard to compare with the North East, as the total number of schools in the North East is much smaller than the number of schools in London. Additionally, the order of the bars seems random, we want to have <em>Outstanding</em> at the top and <em>Inadequate</em> at the bottom, not next to each other:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 to 4 converts <em>OfstedRating</em> from the <em>character</em> datatype to a <em>factor</em>. Factors allow us to categorise the data we store, limiting the number of values a column can hold, in this case we are limiting it to the <em>levels</em> specified, with the order given to levels specifying the order that this column’s data will be displayed in graphs.</li>
<li>5 <code>position</code> tells ggplot what to do when a bar on the x axis is made up of multiple elements, in this case <code>position="fill"</code> will take each x axis bar grouping and work out the fractional value of each Ofsted rating for each Region.</li>
<li>7 when we created the factor on lines 3-4 to pass to the fill command, it also created a really inconvenient title for the graph legend: <em>factor(OfstedRating, levels = c(“Outstanding”, “Good”, “Requires improvement”, “Inadequate”))</em>. <code>scale_fill_discrete</code> let’s us provide a more sensible title for the key.</li>
</ul>
<p>We might also want to look at this graph on a Region by Region basis, at the moment it’s very hard to tell if the East Midlands have more schools that are <em>Outstanding</em>, or more schools that <em>Require improvement</em>. To do compare the bars in each x axis group we can use the position command, setting it to <code>position="dodge"</code>:</p>

<p><code>ggplot</code> can do a lot of the hard work when putting together bar charts, but there might also be times when you want to use pipes to calculate summary values that you then want plot. That is, you want to specify the heights of the bars yourself. To do this we <em>will</em> specify the y axis in the <code>aes</code> and use <code>stat="indentity"</code> to tell ggplot that’s what we’re doing.

<p>What isn’t clear about the above is how this changes on a regional basis. We might be tempted to filter on each region and create separate charts for each regional name. But this would take a considerable amount of time and effort. Another way to do this is using <code>facet_wrap(Region ~ .)</code>.

<p>ggplot can export data in a variety of formats suitable for printing, publication and the web. Once you have created a graph and stored it in an object, the command to save the graph to your hard drive is:</p>
<p><code>ggsave(&lt;file_name_and_extension&gt;, &lt;object_name&gt;)</code></p>
<div class="cell">

<p>If you want to change the output format, just change the extension of the file you are saving:</p>
<ul>
<li>“poverty_size.pdf” perfect for publication and printing, large size</li>
<li>“poverty_size.svg” the same as pdf, also suitable for putting on webpages</li>
<li>“poverty_size.png” smaller file size, suitable for websites and presentations</li>
<li>“poverty_size.jpg” same as the png</li>

<p>Consider how and why we think of things as being ‘normal’ (or not). Some suggested questions are: What were your immediate thoughts on reading this paper?</p>
<p>In what ways have you yourself been aware of being compared to norms or ideals? How do you feel about that? As an education professional, have you made comparisons between individual students and expected norms or averages? Between groups of students? When and how was this useful? When and how was this problematic?</p>

<p>There are probably statistical libraries in R to do every sort of test you will ever need, from the typical ANOVA to cutting edge machine learning. The full list of R packages sits on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">cran server</a> and you can load packages as and when you need them at no cost. R comes pre-packaged with some common statistical tools, for example, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/t.test.html">t.test()</a></code> and linear model regression <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html">lm()</a></code>. For other stats tools you’ll need to install the package (see <a href="#sec-packages">Section&nbsp;2.2.3</a>) and load it (see <span class="citation" data-cites="link-load-packages">(<a href="#ref-link-load-packages" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>link-load-packages?</strong></a>)</span>) before you can use the functions.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Chi-square tests</h2>
<p>Chi squared (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>) tests are <em>non-parametric</em> tests, this means that the test isn’t expecting teh underlying data to be distributed in a certain way. Chi-square determines how well the frequency distribution for a sample fits the population distribution and will let you know when things aren’t distributed as expected. For example you might expect girls and boys to have the same coloured dogs, chi square would tell you whether the null hypothesis, that there is no difference between the categories, is true or not. I.e. girls and boys are equally likely to have the same colours of dog at home.</p>
<p>In more mathematical terms, chi square examines differences between the categories of an independent variable with respect to a dependent variable measured on a nominal (or categorical) scale, that is a scale that has values that aren’t ordered, or continuous, for example Gender or favourite flavour of icecream.</p>
<p>In the example below you will be loading data about Ofsted inspections to see if the Ofsted grade of a state secondary school varies dependent on whether the school is all all boys, all girls or mixed.</p>

This will show the number of providers that match each combination of of the two groupings we are looking at, in this case the OfstedRating and the FSM_group.

<p>The numbers in the contingency table might look odd, but it might be hard to see how far out they are from each other. We can also visualise the data from the contingency table by building a mosaic plot. To do this you are going to need to install and load the <code>ggmosaic</code> package. See packages section for more details on how to do this.</p>
<p>If you were to go and create a mosaic plot you might find that the order of the x and y axis isn’t to your liking:</p>

<p>The order of the x and y axis on the table are defined by the <em>levels</em> of the data. This is a specific R concept, where we have columns stored as factors, with levels. Factors define a column as only allowing a certain set of values, these values are defined by the levels, and the order of the levels.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> How to use it</h2>
<p>The PISA datasets come in <em>SPSS</em> or <em>SAS</em> formats. The data used in this course comes directly from downloading the SPSS <code>.sav</code> files and using the <code>haven</code> package to clean it into a native R format suitable for analysis. There are a few quirks that you need to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R uses levels (factors) instead of labelled data</p></li>
<li><p>All SPSS fields are <em>labelled</em>, and auto conversion into the native R dataframe format would make numeric fields factors(!?). To avoid this confusion we have stripped out the no-response data and replaced it with <code>NA</code> values. This means that you won’t be able to tell the reason that a field is missing, and the following labels have all been set to NA:</p></li>
</ul>
<table class="table">

<ul>
<li>As the fields are now using R’s native factor format you might find that the data doesn’t quite match the format of the table labels. For example, <code>CNT</code> is labelled “Country code 3-character”, but the data is now instead the full country name.</li>
<li>the examples shown above use cut down PISA datasets, where only a limited number of columns are included.</li>

<span class="header-section-number">10.4</span> Common issues</h2>
<p>The PISA datasets can be absolutely huge and might bring your computer to its knees; if you are using a computer with less than 16Gb of RAM you might not be able to load some tables at all. Tables such as the <em>Cognitive</em> dataset have hundreds of thousands of rows and thousands of columns, loading them directly might lead to an error similar to this: <code>Error: cannot allocate vector of size 2.1 Gb</code>. This means that R can’t find enough RAM to load the dataset and has given up. You can see a rough estimate of how much RAM R is currently using the top Environment panel:</p>
<p><img src=".\images/environment-RAM.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>To get around this issues you can try to clean your current R environment using the brush tool:</p>
<p><img src=".\images/environment-brush.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This will drop all the current dataframes, objects, functions and packages that you have loaded meaning you will have to reload packages such as <code><a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org">library(tidyverse)</a></code> and <code><a href="https://haven.tidyverse.org">library(haven)</a></code> before you can attempt to reload the PISA tables.</p>
<p>A lack of RAM might also be the result of lots of other programs running concurrently on your computer. Try to close anything that you don’t need, web browsers can be particularly RAM hungry, so close them or as many tabs as you can.</p>
<p>If none of the above works, then please get in touch with the team, letting them know which table you need from which year, with which fields and for which countries. We will be able to provide you with a cutdown dataset.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">10.5.1</span> What are Plausible Values?</h3>
<p>In the PISA dataset, the outcomes of student tests are reported as plausible values, for example, in the variables of the science test (<code>PV1SCIE</code>, <code>PV2SCIE</code>, <code>PV3SCIE</code>, <code>PV3SCIE</code>, and <code>PV5SCIE</code>). It might seem counter intuitive that there are five values for a score on a test.</p>
<p>Plausible values (PVs) are a way of expressing the error in a measurement. The number of questions in the full PISA survey is very large, so students are randomly allocated to take a subset of questions (and even then, the test still takes two hours!). As no student completes the full set of questions, estimating how a student would have performed on the full question set involves some error. Plausible values are a way of expressing the uncertainty in the estimation of student scores.</p>
<p>One way of thinking of the PV scores is that they represent five different estimates of students’ abilities based on the questions they have answered. To decrease measurement error, five different approaches are applied to create five different estimates, the PV scores.</p>
<p>The PISA Data Analysis Manual suggests:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Population statistics should be estimated using each plausible value separately. The reported population statistic is then the average of each plausible value statistic. For instance, if one is interested in the correlation coefficient between the social index and the reading performance in PISA, then five correlation coefficients should be computed and then averaged</p>
<p>Plausible values should never be averaged at the student level, i.e.&nbsp;by computing in the dataset the mean of the five plausible values at the student level and then computing the statistic of interest once using that average PV value. Doing so would be equivalent to an EAP estimate, with a bias as described in the previous section.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>As of November 2022, <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">Tiobe</a> has R as the 12th most popular programming language. Many other, contradictory, ranking systems exist.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p><code>camelCase</code> has a capital letter in the front or front and middle forming the camel’s hump(s), there are multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)">naming conventions</a>, it doesn’t matter what you pick, just stick to one of them<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>R was created to allow for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming"><em>vector programming</em></a>, that is a programming language where you can apply operations to entire sets of values (vetcors) at the same time, rather than having to cycle through them individually. Vector languages work in a way that is close to how mathematical notation works, making them well suited for performing mathematical functions.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>You’ll sometimes see the words package and library used interchangeably, technically the <em>library</em> is the place where the <em>packages</em> are stored.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Even in this cut down format the PISA data might take a few minutes to load. You can find the full dataset <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQs5mMgG5u7T3qu-9Sei5as8viiw2hAL/view?usp=share_link">here</a>, but be warned, it might crash you machine when trying to load it! Plug your laptop into a power supply, and having 16GB of RAM highly recommended! You might also need to wrangle some of the fields to make them work for your purposes, you might enjoy the challenge!<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>PISA doesn’t recommend you using the PV1 number on a student level and other estimates of maths/science/language ability exist. Please read <a href="#sec-PV">Section&nbsp;10.5.1</a> to find out more<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
