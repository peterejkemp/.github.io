TIMSS is run by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) an international group of national research institutions and governments working to research and improve education. TIMSS launched in 2015\nThe study surveys both 9-10-year-old and 13-14-year-old students, across 64 countries (in 2019). Contextual data about schools, teachers and parents is collected in the survey. TIMSS advanced (running since 1995) collects data on students in their final year of secondary schooling.\nYou can read more about TIMSS, and download data sets, from the TIMSS website: TIMSS\n\n\n2 What is PIRLS?\nPIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) is the IEA’S parallel study to TIMSS which focuses on international literacy. The study samples 9-10-year old students and has taken place every five years since 2001.\nYou can read more about PIRLS, and download data sets, from the PIRLS website: TIMSS\n\n\n3 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS)\nICILS is the IEA international comparative assessment of students’ computing and IT literacy.

    "text": "4.1 What are Plausible Values?\nIn the PISA dataset, the outcomes of student tests are reported as plausible values, for example, in the variables of the science test (PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV3SCIE, and PV5SCIE). It might seem counter intuitive that there are five values for a score on a test.\nPlausible values (PVs) are a way of expressing the error in a measurement. The number of questions in the full PISA survey is very large, so students are randomly allocated to take a subset of questions (and even then, the test still takes two hours!). As no student completes the full set of questions (only 40% of students even answer questions in reading, science and mathematics OECD (2014)), estimating how a student would have performed on the full question set involves some error. Plausible values are a way of expressing the uncertainty in the estimation of student scores.\nOne way of thinking of the PV scores is that they represent five different estimates of students’ abilities based on the questions they have answered. To decrease measurement error, five different approaches are applied to create five different estimates, the PV scores.\nThe PISA Data Analysis Manual suggests:\n\nPopulation statistics should be estimated using each plausible value separately. The reported population statistic is then the average of each plausible value statistic. For instance, if one is interested in the correlation coefficient between the social index and the reading performance in PISA, then five correlation coefficients should be computed and then averaged\nPlausible values should never be averaged at the student level, i.e. by computing in the dataset the mean of the five plausible values at the student level and then computing the statistic of interest once using that average PV value. Doing so would be equivalent to an EAP estimate, with a bias as described in the previous section.\n(Monseur et al. 2009, 100)"

A number of classes of students are excluded from data collection:\n\nStudents classed as ‘functionally disabled’ so that they cannot participate in the test.\nJudged by teachers to have cognitive, emotional or behavioural difficulties that mean they cannot participate.\nThe student lacks language abilities to take the test in the assessment language.\nThere are no test material available in the student’s language\nAnother agreed reason\n\nThe OECD expect that 85% of schools in their original sample participate - nonparticipating schools can be replaced with a substitute, ‘replacement’ school.

The line of best fit is the line where the sum of the residuals squared is the smallest number possible.\n\n\nMethod of Least Squares\n\nThe line that is created can be described by the equation:\nOutput = Intercept + Coefficient * Input \nLet’s use linear regression to explore the relationship between the score in maths(PV1MATH) and the score in reading (PV1READ).

The null hypothesis is that one variable does not predict another, we can dismiss this. By looking at the Estimate we can also see by how much a PV1MATH grade would increase if the PV1READ increased by one: 0.7731.

R2 - An estimate of R2 in the population (shrinkage), often very similar to plain R2.\n\nImagine we take two experiments a) and b)\n\n\n(a) larger effect-size; (b) smaller effect-size from Coe (2002)\n\nBoth have statistically significant results, but it’s clear that the impact of the intervention in graph a) is larger as there is less overlap between the curves, i.e. there is more difference between the the outcomes.\n\nif the difference were as in graph (a) it would be very significant; in graph (b), on the other hand, the difference might hardly be noticeable (Coe 2002, p2)\n\nDifferent effect sizes have different meanings and there is some debate on how to interpret them, with different interpretations for different fields of research (Schäfer and Schwarz 2019)\n\nHow to interpret effect sizes (Cohen 1962)\n\n\nEffect size value\nEffect size\n\n\n\n0.0 to 0.19\nnegligible\n\n\n0.2 to 0.49\nsmall\n\n\n0.5 to 0.79\nmedium\n\n\n0.8+\nlarge\n\n\n\nYou might be familiar with the Education Endowment Foundation’s Teaching and Learning Toolkit which outlines the Impact of different interventions on student learning. For example, repeating a year is seen to decrease student progress by 3 months and providing students with feedback is seen to increase student progress by 6 months. Behind the scenes they are using effect-sizes to predict the impact of educational interventions. In their model an effect-size of 0.1 is considered to have “Low impact”, but also an effect size of this magnitude is translated to 2 months progress in the Toolkit (Higgins et al. 2016, 5)."

    "text": "9.1 Recreating Stoet and Geary’s paper\nStoet and Geary’s 2018 paper: “The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education” presented controversial findings, including how the increased female uptake of STEM degrees in country could be partially explained (using regression) by the decreased gender equality in that country. We are going to explore part of this paper by looking at another finding (figure 3a) that looked at girls’ achievement in the PISA_2015 science test compared to their maths and reading grades. Comparing this relative grade to boys in the same country, it showed that as gender equality of their country increased, the gap got bigger, i.e. the more gender equal a country, the worse the female relative performance in science.\n\nThe gender gap in intraindividual science scores (a) was larger in more gender-equal countries (rs = .42)"

Stoet and Geary (2018) explore gender differences in outcomes with gender equality in countries (see their figures 3 and 4), by using the PISA_2015 data set with the science efficacy SCIEEFF, and science performance (maybe PV1SCIE, or a aggregation of PV1, PV2 etc ) fields; mapping this data set to the 2015 Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI). Let’s try and recreate what they did.\nFirst we are going to download the GGGI, unfortunately, it’s difficult to find the 2015 data set, so we’ll use 2013 instead, which can be found here\nThe data is in a .csv format so we need to use read.csv to get it into R (make sure that you use read.csv rather than read_csv as the names will come out slightly differently)\n\n# load the GGGI\nGGGI &lt;- read.csv(\"&lt;folder&gt;table-3b-detailed-rankings-2013.csv\")\n\nIf we look at the names of the GGGI fields we find that there is a Country column and the Overall.Score column, these are the columns that we are interested in.

    "text": "9.4 Standardising PISA results\nNext, we will try to wrangle the data into shape to recreate figure 3 from Stoet and Geary (2018). To do this we first need to standardise the grades for maths, science and reading so we can compare the results of students between countries without low performing or high performing countries skewing the results (see Chapter 7 for details on how to standardise data). Following the steps outlined on page 7:\n\n\nWe standardized the mathematics, science, and reading scores on a nation-by-nation basis. We call these new standardized scores zMath, zRead, and zScience.\nWe calculated for each student the standardized average score of the new z-scores and we call this zGeneral.\nThen, we calculated for each student their intra-individual strengths by subtracting zGeneral as follows: relativeSciencestrength = zScience - zGeneral, relativeMathstrength = zMath - zGeneral, relativeReadingstrength = zReading - zGeneral.\nFinally, using these new intra-individual (relative) scores, we calculated for each country the averages for boys and girls and subtracted those to calculate the gender gaps in relative academic strengths\n\n\nproduces the following code:\n\ncode# standardise the results for each student in line with pg7\n# https://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/4753/6/symplectic-version.pdf\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# step 1\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015_GGGI %&gt;% \n  rename(gender = ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  mutate(zMaths   = scale(PV1MATH),\n         zScience = scale(PV1SCIE), \n         zReading = scale(PV1READ))\n\n# step 2\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  mutate(zGeneral = (zMaths + zScience + zReading) / 3)\n\n# step 3\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  mutate(rel_MATH = zMaths   - zGeneral,\n         rel_SCIE = zScience - zGeneral,\n         rel_READ = zReading - zGeneral)\n\n# step 4 part 1\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT, gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(zMaths = mean(zMaths, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zScience = mean(zScience, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zReading = mean(zReading, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zGeneral = mean(zGeneral, na.rm=TRUE),\n            rel_MATH = zMaths - zGeneral,\n            rel_SCIE = zScience - zGeneral,\n            rel_READ = zReading - zGeneral,\n            gggi = unique(Overall.Score))\n\n# step 4 part 2\npisa_gggi_diff &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, gender, gggi, rel_SCIE) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = gender,\n              values_from = rel_SCIE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(difference =  Male - Female)\n\n\nFinally we will plot the results:\n\ngraph codelibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot(pisa_gggi_diff,\n       aes(x=difference, y=gggi)) + \n  geom_point(colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\") +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label=CNT),\n            box.padding = 0.2,\n            max.overlaps = Inf,\n            colour=\"black\") +\n  xlab(paste0(\"relative difference in PV1SCIE scores (male-female)\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe graph is pretty good recreation of what the paper presented, with the general shape the same; differences in grades for each country might be explained by the original paper using 5 plausible values rather than just PV1SCIE, as we have used (Stoet and Geary 2020). Does the statistical model stand up to scrutiny? To find out we will use correlation. Stoet and Geary used Spearman’s rho, signified by the s in rs:\n\nThe most important and novel finding here is that the sex difference in intraindividual strength in science was higher and more favorable to boys in more gender-equal countries, rs = .42, 95% CI = [.19,.61], p &lt; .001, n = 62 (Fig. 3a)\n\nWe can run our version of this model using the following:\n\nresult &lt;- cor.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi, \n                    pisa_gggi_diff$difference, \n                    method=\"spearman\")\nresult\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  pisa_gggi_diff$gggi and pisa_gggi_diff$difference\nS = 24384, p-value = 0.02763\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n      rho \n0.2874342 \n\n\nOur model doesn’t show such a strong correlation. In fact, our model shows a “weak positive” relationship of just 0.287, albeit a significant one (p&lt;0.05).\nFor our version of this model it seems unnecessary to use Spearman’s rho, the number of countries we are comparing with valid data is 59 (pisa_gggi_diff %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% nrow()), which is greater than 30 and using the central limit theorem we should be able to use Pearson’s r. Additionally,shapiro.teston both difference andgggi give non-significant results, suggesting Pearson is the better test to use here:\n\nshapiro.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi) \n#&gt; p-value = 0.1226\nshapiro.test(pisa_gggi_diff$difference)\n#&gt; p-value = 0.4078\n\nIf we run the model again using Pearson’s r, we get:\n\nresult &lt;- cor.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi, \n                    pisa_gggi_diff$difference, \n                    method=\"pearson\")\nresult\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  pisa_gggi_diff$gggi and pisa_gggi_diff$difference\nt = 3.9972, df = 57, p-value = 0.0001863\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2406661 0.6465242\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4679109 \n\n\nA result much closer to the one published. The differences here might be the result of the different GGGI data set we used or a difference in the way we calculated difference, or something to do with the correlation model used. It would be good to know!\nWe can also explore this data using regression and a linear model looking at the relationship between difference in grades and the gggi value for each country:\n\nmdl &lt;- lm(difference ~ gggi, data = pisa_gggi_diff)\nsummary(mdl)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = difference ~ gggi, data = pisa_gggi_diff)\n\nResiduals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.067343 -0.018964 -0.003605  0.023548  0.083991 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept) -0.12926    0.05317  -2.431 0.018228 *  \ngggi         0.29826    0.07462   3.997 0.000186 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 0.03247 on 57 degrees of freedom\n  (14 observations deleted due to missingness)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.2189,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.2052 \nF-statistic: 15.98 on 1 and 57 DF,  p-value: 0.0001863\n\n\nThis model also finds a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) and an estimate for gggi of 0.298, i.e. for each increase of 1 in gggi, males will do 0.298 of a standard deviation better than females. The R2 is pretty decent too at 0.219 suggesting the finding that Stoet and Geary reported is a sound one."

Alternatively, we can visualise the data from the contingency table by building a mosaic plot, a form of stacked bar chart. Mosaic plots can be a useful visulations before running a chi-squared test.\nTo create a mosaic plot, you are going to need to install and load the ggmosaic package. See ?@sec-load-run-pckges for more details on how to do this.\nImagine we want to plot the ‘accomplishment’ data (WB178Q01HA) from the previous section for the Netherlands, Mexico and New Zealand.\nTo create the mosaic plot we use ggplot, as we used for previous graphs. As before, we first pass the data (in this case Accomp) to ggplot. Then, to create the graph, geom_mosaic is used. geom_mosaic does not have a direct mapping of input to x and y variable so we need to pass it what we want plotted on the y-axis (WB178Q01HA) and x-axis (CNT) within the product function (product(WB178Q01HA, CNT)). We can also specify how we want the rectangles to be coloured (in our case, by CNT).\n\n # install.packages(\"ggmosaic\")\nlibrary(ggmosaic)\n\n# Create a data frame of accomplishment data for the 3 countries\nAccomp&lt;-PISA_2022%&gt;%\n  select(WB178Q01HA, CNT)%&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Netherlands\" | CNT == \"Mexico\"| CNT == \"New Zealand\")%&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\n# plot results\n# Note that with geom_mosaic you pass the x and y variables using: aes(x = product(WB178Q01HA, CNT))\n\nggplot(data = Accomp) +\n  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(WB178Q01HA, CNT), fill = CNT))+\n  xlab(\"Country\")+\n  ylab(\"Did you accomplish something yesterday?\")\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the mosaic plot the width of the bars represents the number of students in the sample for each country."

    "text": "The tidyverse includes the incredibly powerful ggplot2 package. This package is pretty much the industry standard for making graphs for publication. ggplot2 is built on the grammar of graphics where you build graphs by specifying underlying attributes and layering geometric objects on top of each other. In the diagram below you can see how a graph is built from geometric objects (the things that are plotted such as points and bars) a scale, and plot annotations (e.g. a key, title etc). You can then apply faceting to the graph to automatically split one graph into multiple plots, allowing you to easily compare different groupings. Publications, such as the Financial Times, make daily use of ggplot2."

The below example shows how we can specify within the ggplot function data=country_plot_data.

Once these have been declared in the ggplot(...) function, their values are passed down to any subsequent geom_, in this case geom_point will use the data and x and y values that have been specified in ggplot(...)\n\n# create a new dataframe of maths and reading scores by country and OECD status\ncountry_plot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH),\n            mean_read = mean(PV1READ),\n            sz = n())\n\n# using this new dataframe, show the relationship between maths and reading score\n# using geom_points\nggplot(data=country_plot_data, \n       aes(x=mean_maths, y=mean_read)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size=sz, colour=OECD), alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line 2 above we pipe the large data.frame PISA_2022 to apply a number of functions.\nLine 3 groups by OECD (a Yes or No indicating membership) and CNT (the name of the country).\nLines 4-5 calculate the mean mathematics and reading score, and create new variables (mean_maths, and mean_read) for their values.\nIn addition, in line 6, the variables sz is created which counts the number of responses per country through the n() command.\nThis whole pipe is then saved to the country_plot_data object, using the &lt;- on line 2\n\nThis new dataframe is then passed to ggplot.\n\nIn line 10, we specify the data that should be plotted - the new dataframe country_plot_data we have created.\nLine 11, then we pass the x and y variables, mean_maths, and mean_read, inside the aesthetic function. These values will be passed to any subsequent geom_\nIn line 12, we make a number of tweaks to the points: first setting the aesthetics - the size of the points is linked to the sz variable we created, the number of responses per country, and the colour is linked to OECD membership.

To compare different groups we need the bars to not be stacked, we want them next to each other, or in ggplot language, we want the bars to dodge each other, to do this we add the position=position_dodge() command to line 3 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Raising the bars yourself\nggplot can do a lot of the hard work when putting together bar charts, e.g. counting the number of students in each group, but there might also be times when you want to use pipes to calculate summary values that you then want plot. That is, you want to specify the heights of the bars yourself. To do this we will specify the y axis in the aes and use stat=\"indentity\" to tell ggplot that’s what we’re doing. Take the example where you want to find the overall percentage of students for a range of countries getting over 500 in PV1SCIE:\n\nplot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(all_students = n(),\n            upper_sci_per = sum(PV1SCIE &gt; 500) / n())\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=CNT, y=upper_sci_per)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=OECD), \n           position=position_dodge(),\n           stat=\"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n1 to 4 creates a dataframe plot_data that calculates the percentage of students in each country CNT, that have a science grade PV1SCIE over 500\n7 as we are setting the heights of the bars ourselves, we need to give the ggplot aes command a y value, in this case y=upper_sci_per\n8 the geom_bar is given a fill value of OECD, this will allow us to see how countries in and out of the OECD compare\n9 we use position=position_dodge() as we want the percentage grades of each country to be next to each other so we can look for differences in heights\n10 stat=\"identity\" tells geom_bar that you have defined your own bar heights in the y attribute and not to count the number of rows.\n11 this theme command helps rotate the x-axis labels 90 degrees, so they don’t overlap.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the geom_col() function that can handle you setting the y values and not specifying stat=\"identity\"\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=CNT, y=upper_sci_per)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill=OECD), \n           position=position_dodge()) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the 4 errors in this code.\n\n\nggplot(data=schools %&gt;% filter(Phase == \"Secondary\"), \n       x=Region +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=Gender) position=\"full\") \n\n\n\nanswer\nggplot(data=schools %&gt;% filter(Phase == \"Secondary\"), \n       aes(x=Region)) + # 1 no aes() around the x value # 2 missing close brackets\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=Gender), position=\"fill\") # 3 missing comma # 4 position=\"full\" rather than fill \n\n\n\nCreate a bar chart showing the total number of students for each grouping of “How satisfied are you with each of the following: The way that you look” WB155Q02HA.

The x location of the labels is inherited from line 4 and the y location will be calculated from the height of each bar\nline 8 we want the labels to align to the bars, so we tell the geom_text to also position_dodge, passing a width=0.9 to the dodge function, so the labels line up above the columns,\nfinally, on line 9, we vertically adjust the labels vjust, so they sit on top of the columns.\n\nRather than adding the count, you might want to add the percentage that each bar represents, we can do this by changing the value given to label on line 5, below:\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST251Q01JA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +\n  geom_text(stat='count', \n            aes(label=100*(..count../sum(..count..)) %&gt;% round(3), \n            group = OECD), \n            position = position_dodge(width=0.9),\n            vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, when we make graphs we often want to label the dataset, for example if we were to plot all the countries and their PV1MATH and PV1READ scores, we would get:\n\nplot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(m_read  = mean(PV1READ, na.rm=\"TRUE\"),\n            m_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=\"TRUE\"))\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\nThis looks great, but we don’t actually know which countries are which. To get this data we need to add text to the graph, using geom_text.\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(aes(label=CNT), \n            colour=\"black\", \n            check_overlap = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nHere we have used colour=\"black\" outside the aes to define the colour for all the labels, and check_overlap = TRUE which removes any labels that are on top of each other.

We will consider the potential value of quantitative research, and consider the process of quantising latent variables. Latent variables are variables that can only be inferred indirectly from data. For example, consider intelligence - there is no way to measure intelligence directly, we have to base our assumptions of intelligence on performance on some tasks, such as those in intelligence tests. Many variables of interest to educational researchers are latent variables (consider, attitudes to subjects, academic achievement, interest, belonging etc.)\nIn this session we will consider the affordances and challenges of constructing quantitaitve variables in the context of educational research."

To do this we will be using the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE), a desktop application to support you in writing R scripts. R Studio supports your programming by flagging up errors in your code as you write it, and helping you manage your analysis environment by giving you quick access to tables, objects and graphs as you develop them. In addition, we will be looking at data analysis using the tidyverse code packages. The tidyverse is a standardised collection of supporting code that helps you read data, tidy it into a usable format, analyse it and present your findings.\nThe R programming language offers similar functionality to an application based statistical tool such as SPSS, with more of a focus on you writing code to solve your problems, rather than using prebuilt tools. R is open source, meaning that it is free to use and that lots of people have written code in R that they have shared with others. R statistical libraries are some of the most comprehensive in existence. R is popular1 in academia and industry, being used for everything from sales modelling to cancer detection.\n# This example shows how R can pull data directly from the internet\n# tidy it and start making graphs.

The sequential and modular nature of these files makes it very easy to develop and test each stage separately, reuse code in the future, and share with others.\nThis booklet is written with the following sections to support you:\n# Code examples and questions appear like this\na &lt;- 1 + 3\nCourier font indicates keyboard presses, column names, column values and function names.\n&lt;folder&gt; Courier font within brackets describe values that can be passed to functions and that you need to define yourself.

    "section": "\n3.4 Datatypes",
    "text": "3.4 Datatypes\nWe have already met two different datatypes, the character datatype for words and letters (e.g. \"Peter\") and the numeric datatype for numbers (e.g. 12). Datatypes tell R how to handle data in certain circumstances. Sometimes data will be of the wrong datatype and you will need to convert between datatypes.\n\nweeks &lt;- 4\ndays_in_week &lt;- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\n# but it doesn't work!\ntotal_days &lt;- weeks * days_in_week \n\nError in weeks * days_in_week: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nWhilst R will understand what to do when we multiply numbers with numbers, it gets very confused and raises an error when we try to perform an arithmetic operation using words and numbers.\nTo perform the calculation we will need to convert the days_in_week from a string to a number, using the as.numeric(&lt;text&gt;) command:\n\nweeks &lt;- 4\ndays_in_week &lt;- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\ntotal_days &lt;- weeks * as.numeric(days_in_week)\n\nThere is a logical datatype for boolean values of TRUE and FALSE. This will become a lot more useful later.\n\nlegs_snake &lt;- FALSE # you can specify logical values directly\ndogs_legs &lt;- 4\nlegs_dog &lt;- dogs_legs &gt; 0 # or as part of a calculation\n\n# Do dog's have legs?\nprint(legs_dog)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThere are actually three datatypes for numbers in R, numeric for most of your work, the rarer integer specifically for whole numbers and the even rarer complex for complex numbers. When you are looking at categorical data, factors are used on top of the underlying datatype to store the different values, for example you might have a field of character to store countries, factors would then list the different countries stored in this character field.\nTo change from one datatype to another we use the as.____ command: as.numeric(&lt;text&gt;), as.logical(&lt;data&gt;), as.character(&lt;numeric&gt;).\n\n3.4.1 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix them so it outputs: “July is month 7”?\n\n\nmonth &lt;- \"July\"\norder &lt;- 7\n  \nprint(month)\nPrint(\"is\")\nprint(month)\nprint(\"order\")\n\n\nanswermonth &lt;- \"July\"\norder &lt;- 7\n  \nprint(month)    \nprint(\"is\")     #1 print needs a lowercase p\nprint(\"month\")  #2 month is a character not an object, use speech marks\nprint(order)    #3 order is an object, not a character, so drop the speech marks\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\na &lt;- 7\nb &lt;- \"8\"\nc &lt; - 3\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\nanswera &lt;- 7\nb &lt;- 8 #1 b is numeric so drop the speech marks\nc &lt;- 3 #2 the arrow needs to be together, remove the space\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\npass mark &lt;- 50 \nexam_grade &lt;- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade &gt; pass_mark)\n\n\nanswerpass_mark &lt;- 50 #1 the variable name can't have any spaces\nexam_grade &lt;- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade &gt;= pass_mark) # this needs to be &gt;= as they had a passing grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to find out the datatype of an object you can use the structure str command to give you more information about the object. In this instance chr means that month is of character datatype and num means it is of the numeric datatype.\n\nmonth &lt;- \"July\"\nstr(month)\n\n chr \"July\"\n\nmonth &lt;- 7\nstr(month)\n\n num 7"

    "text": "Piping allows us to break down complex tasks into manageable chunks that can be written and tested one after another. There are several powerful commands in the tidyverse as part of the dplyr package that can help us group, filter, select, mutate and summarise datasets. With this small set of commands we can use piping to convert massive datasets into simple and useful results.\nUsing the pipe %&gt;% command, we can feed the results from one command into the next command making for reusable and easy to read code.\nLet’s look at an example of using the pipe on the PISA_2022 table to calculate the best performing OECD countries for maths PV1MATH by gender ST004D01T:\n1PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  filter(OECD == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n3  group_by(CNT, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n4  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd_maths = sd(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            students = n()) %&gt;%\n5  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T)) %&gt;%\n6  arrange(desc(mean_maths))\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 passes the whole PISA_2022 dataset and pipes it into the next line using %&gt;%\n\n2\n\nline 2 filters out any results that are from non-OECD countries by finding all the rows where OECD equals == “Yes”, this is then piped to the next line\n\n3\n\nline 3 groups the data by country CNT and by student gender ST004D01T, this is then piped to the next line\n\n4\n\nline 4-6 the summarise command performs a calculation on the country and gender groupings returning three new columns, each command is described by code on a new line and separated by a comma: the mean value for maths mean_maths, the standard deviation sd_maths, and a column telling us how many students were in each grouping using the n() which returns the number of rows in a group. These new columns and the grouping columns are then piped to the next line, all other columns are dropped\n\n5\n\nline 7 filters out any gender ST004D01T that is NA. First is finds all the students that have NA as their gender by using is.na(ST004D01T), then it NOTs/flips the result using the exclamation mark !, giving those students who don’t have their gender set to NA. The filtered data is then piped to the next line\n\n6\n\nline 8, finally we arrange/sort the results in descending order by the mean_maths column. The default for arrange is ascending order, leave out the desc(  ) for the numbers to be ordered in the opposite way.\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 74 × 5\n# Groups:   CNT [37]\n   CNT            ST004D01T mean_maths sd_maths students\n   &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Japan          Male            540.     99.0     2856\n 2 Korea          Male            534.    112.      3325\n 3 Japan          Female          531.     88.1     2904\n 4 Korea          Female          528.     99.1     3129\n 5 Estonia        Male            515.     87.4     3272\n 6 Switzerland    Male            511.     99.3     3540\n 7 Estonia        Female          510.     81.5     3120\n 8 Czech Republic Male            502.    100.      4232\n 9 Switzerland    Female          501.     90.9     3289\n10 Austria        Male            500.     94.5     3110\n# ℹ 64 more rows\nAcross the top few countries, Males get a slightly better maths score PV1MATH than Females, other scores are available, please read ?@sec-PV to find out more about the limitations of using a “PV” value.\nThe commands we have just used come from a package within the tidyverse called dplyr, let’s take a look at what they do:"

In the example below, we are going to add a new column to the PISA_2022 dataset (using mutate) noting whether a student got a higher grade in their Maths PV1MATH or Reading PV1READ tests. if PV1MATH is bigger then PV1READ, the maths_better is TRUE, else maths_better is FALSE, or in dplyr format:\n\nmaths_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  mutate(maths_better = \n           ifelse(PV1MATH &gt; PV1READ,\n                  TRUE, \n                  FALSE)) %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST004D01T, maths_better, PV1MATH, PV1READ)\n\nprint(maths_data)\n\n# A tibble: 613,744 × 5\n   CNT     ST004D01T maths_better PV1MATH PV1READ\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;lgl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Albania Female    FALSE           180.    248.\n 2 Albania Male      TRUE            308.    258.\n 3 Albania Male      FALSE           268.    285.\n 4 Albania Female    FALSE           273.    322.\n 5 Albania Female    FALSE           435.    464.\n 6 Albania Male      TRUE            534.    451.\n 7 Albania Male      FALSE           382.    391.\n 8 Albania Female    FALSE           273.    308.\n 9 Albania Female    FALSE           355.    429.\n10 Albania Female    TRUE            430.    420.\n# ℹ 613,734 more rows\n\n\nWe now take this new dataset maths_data and look at whether the difference between relative performance in maths and reading is the same for girls and boys:\n\nmaths_data %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T), !is.na(maths_better)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ST004D01T, maths_better) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n()) \n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n# Groups:   ST004D01T [2]\n  ST004D01T maths_better      n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;lgl&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Female    FALSE        180350\n2 Female    TRUE         125409\n3 Male      FALSE        118341\n4 Male      TRUE         189565\n\n\n\nAdjust the code above to work out the percentages of Males and Females ST004D01T in each group.

Take this example. Let’s flag students who have a different home language LANGN to the language that is being used in the PISA assessment tool LANGTEST_QQQ. We make an assumption here that the assessment tool will be the language used at school, so these students will be learning in a different language to their mother tongue. if LANGN equals LANGTEST_QQQ, the lang_diff is FALSE, else lang_diff is TRUE, this raises an error:\n\nlang_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  mutate(lang_diff = \n           ifelse(LANGN == LANGTEST_QQQ,\n                  FALSE, \n                  TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, lang_diff, LANGTEST_QQQ, LANGN)\n\nError in `mutate()`:\nℹ In argument: `lang_diff = ifelse(LANGN == LANGTEST_QQQ, FALSE, TRUE)`.\nCaused by error in `Ops.factor()`:\n! level sets of factors are different\n\n\nThe levels in each field are different, i.e. the range of home languages is larger than the range of test languages. To fix this, all we need to do is change the datatype of the factors LANGN and LANGTEST_QQQ to characters using as.character(&lt;field&gt;). This will then allow the comparison of the text stored in each row:\n\nlang_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  mutate(lang_diff = \n           ifelse(as.character(LANGN) == as.character(LANGTEST_QQQ),\n                  FALSE, \n                  TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, lang_diff, LANGTEST_QQQ, LANGN)\n\nprint(lang_data)\n\n# A tibble: 613,744 × 4\n   CNT     lang_diff LANGTEST_QQQ LANGN   \n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;   \n 1 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 2 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 3 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 4 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 5 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 6 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 7 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 8 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 9 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n10 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n# ℹ 613,734 more rows\n\n\nWe can now look at this dataset to get an idea of which countries have the largest percentage of students learning in a language other than their mother tongue:\n\nlang_data_diff &lt;- lang_data %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  mutate(student_n = n()) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT, lang_diff) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            percentage = 100*(n / max(student_n))) %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(lang_diff),\n         lang_diff == TRUE)\n\nprint(lang_data_diff)\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 4\n# Groups:   CNT [80]\n   CNT                  lang_diff     n percentage\n   &lt;fct&gt;                &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Albania              TRUE        720      11.7 \n 2 United Arab Emirates TRUE      13933      56.6 \n 3 Argentina            TRUE        788       6.51\n 4 Australia            TRUE       1827      13.6 \n 5 Austria              TRUE       1455      23.7 \n 6 Belgium              TRUE       2445      29.5 \n 7 Bulgaria             TRUE        961      15.7 \n 8 Brazil               TRUE        559       5.18\n 9 Brunei Darussalam    TRUE       4831      86.6 \n10 Canada               TRUE       5971      25.9 \n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\n\nThis looks like a promising dataset, but there are some strange results:\n\nlang_data_diff %&gt;% filter(percentage &gt; 92)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n# Groups:   CNT [8]\n  CNT                          lang_diff     n percentage\n  &lt;fct&gt;                        &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Hong Kong (China)            TRUE       5626       95.2\n2 Macao (China)                TRUE       4384      100  \n3 Montenegro                   TRUE       5596       96.6\n4 Norway                       TRUE       6611      100  \n5 Philippines                  TRUE       6693       93.0\n6 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE       3747       96.7\n7 Singapore                    TRUE       6567       99.4\n8 Chinese Taipei               TRUE       5821       99.4\n\n\nExploring data for Ukraine, we can see that a different spelling has been used in each field, Ukrainian and Ukranain, an incorrect spelling.\n\nlang_data %&gt;% filter(CNT == \"Ukrainian regions (18 of 27)\")\n\n# A tibble: 3,876 × 4\n   CNT                          lang_diff LANGTEST_QQQ LANGN    \n   &lt;fct&gt;                        &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;    \n 1 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 2 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 3 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Russian  \n 4 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 5 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 6 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 7 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Russian  \n 8 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 9 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n10 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n# ℹ 3,866 more rows\n\n\nifelse can help here too.

    "section": "8.2 Factors and statistical data types",
    "text": "8.2 Factors and statistical data types\nThe types of variable will heavily influence what statistical analysis you can perform. R is there to help by assigning datatypes to each field. We have different sorts of data that can be stored:\n\n\nCategorical - data that can be divided into groups or categories\n\nNominal - categorical data where the order isn’t important, e.g. gender, or colours\nOrdinal - categorical data that may have order or ranking, e.g. exam grades (A, B, C, D) or lickert scales (strongly agree, agree, disgaree, strongly disagree)\n\nNumeric - data that consists of numbers\n\nContinuous - numeric data that can take any value within a given range, e.g. height (178cm, 134.54cm)\nDiscrete - numeric data that can take only certain values within a range, e.g. number of children in a family (0,1,2,3,4,5)\n\n\nBut here we are going to look at how R handles factors. Factors have two parts, levels and codes. levels are what you see when you view a table column, codes are an underlying order to the data. Factors allow you to store data that has a known set of values that you might want to display in an order other than alphabetical. For example, if we look at the month field ST003D02T using the levels(&lt;field&gt;) command:\n\nlevels(PISA_2022$ST003D02T)\n\n [1] \"January\"        \"February\"       \"March\"          \"April\"         \n [5] \"May\"            \"June\"           \"July\"           \"August\"        \n [9] \"September\"      \"October\"        \"November\"       \"December\"      \n[13] \"Valid Skip\"     \"Not Applicable\" \"Invalid\"        \"No Response\"   \n\n\nWe can see that the months of the year are there along with other possible levels. With this particular dataset, we have set all other levels as NA.\nCodes are the underlying numbers/order for each level, in this case 1 = January, 2 = February, etc.\n\nas.numeric(PISA_2022$ST003D02T)\n\n [1]  5  2  8  7  1  5  5 12  8  9 10  4  5  8  7  2  3  6  3  8 10  1 10  2  5\n[26]  6  8  1  3  2  5  7 12  4  1 10 10  3  3  9\n [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 613704 entries ]\n\n\nHow can this be useful? A good example is how plots are made, they will use the codes to give an order to the display of columns, in the plot below, February (2) comes before March (3), even though there were more students born in March:\n\ngrph_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n         group_by(ST003D02T) %&gt;% \n         summarise(n=n())\n\ngrph_data %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% pull(ST003D02T)\n\n [1] September October   August    July      May       June      January  \n [8] March     November  December  April     February  &lt;NA&gt;     \nattr(,\"label\")\n[1] Student (Standardized) Birth - Month\n16 Levels: January February March April May June July August ... No Response\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nTo re-order the columns to match the number of students, we can either try to do this manually, which is rather cumbersome:\n\nmy_levels &lt;- c(\"September\", \"October\", \"August\", \"July\", \"May\", \"June\", \n               \"January\", \"March\", \"November\", \"December\", \"April\", \"February\",\n               \"Valid Skip\", \"Not Applicable\", \"Invalid\", \"No Response\")\n\ngrph_data$ST003D02T &lt;- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nIt takes a lot of work to manually input the levels, we can get R to do this for us:\n\n# get the levels in order and pull/create a vector of them\nmy_levels &lt;- grph_data %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% pull(ST003D02T)\n\n# reassign the re-ordered levels to the dataframe column\ngrph_data$ST003D02T &lt;- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nTo learn a lot more about factors, see Hadley’s chapter"

    "text": "2.1 Using the command line for descriptive statistics\nFor further reading on descriptive statistics see chapter 5 of Navaro’s Learning Statistics with R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe are going to focus on the following variables in the PISA_2022 data frame:\n\nCNT the country of the student.\nHOMEPOS is a self-reported measure of a student’s wealth, linked to the number of possessions students report having in their home (e.g. books, computers, cars, phones etc.). It is a numeric variable, with a mean of -0.447, minimum of -10.07 and a maximum of 15.24.\nESCS is the index of economic, social and cultural status. It might be thought of as a measure of economic and social status (with some cultural capital measures included). It is a numeric variable, with a mean of -0.310, minimum of -6.84 and a maximum of 7.38. It is constructed from three items: highest parental occupation (HISEI), highest level of parental education (PARED), and home possessions (HOMEPOS), including books in the home\nPV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ are the plausible value scores for achievement tests in mathematics, science and reading, respectively. The full achievement tests are long, so each student only completes a subset of items (which still takes 2 hours). Statistical models are then used to calculate an overall score, based on the students’ answers to the subset of questions, as if students had answered all the questions. Ten different approaches (ten different statistical models, that take different approaches to estimating the overalls score are used) to calculating a representative scores, plausible values are used, leading to ten different plausible values. In this course, will just use the first plausible value (PV1). This differs from the PISA recommendation for using the scores, but simplifies things for teaching. For more on plausible values see: What are plausible values?\nST004D01T is the gender variable and and can take the values: Male, Female or NA.\n\n\n\nThe simplest way to find information about a data frame is to use the console. You can type commands to find out about a data frame directly into the console. To preform an action on a particular column (also called a vector), we use the $ symbol. For example, to refer to country data (which is in the vector CNT) we would use PISA_2022$CNT\nIn the command line, if you want to find the mean of all the science scores you can type the following:\n\nmean(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE)\n\nNotice that you get this response: [1] NA. An NA in the data frame can occur for a number of reasons, for example it may indicate a response is missing or incomplete, hence the mean can’t be calculated. To tell R to ignore NAs, we add na.rm = TRUE to a function:\n\nmean(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nYou can use the command line with a number of functions to find useful information about a data frame. R has a number of standard functions that might be useful for descriptive statistics. To find out details about data frames, you can use:\n\n\nnrow() finds the number of rows (e.g. nrow(PISA_2022))\n\nncol() finds the number of columns (e.g. ncol(PISA_2022))\n\nnames() finds the names of all the columns (e.g. names(PISA_2022))\n\nIf you are working on individual columns, e.g. max(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE), you can use:\n\n\nmean() - finds the arithmetic mean\n\nmedian() - finds the median value\n\nmin() - finds the minimum value\n\nmax() - finds the maximum value\n\nsd() - finds the standard deviation\n\nrange() - finds the range of values\n\nlength()- finds the number of items\n\nunique() - finds the unique items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMaybe surprisingly, there is no function to calculate the mode in the tidyverse package. However, you can get one by loading the modeest package and using the most frequent value (mfv) function.\n\n# Install the modeest package to calculate a mode\n\nlibrary(modeest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# The mode can be found with the most frequent value (mfv) function\n# We can create a data frame for UK mathematics scores\n\nPISAUKMath&lt;-PISA_2022%&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH)\n\n# Then use mfv to find the mode value (note the na.rm=TRUE to avoid NAs)\n\nmfv(PISA_2022$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 386.086\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can read a complete list of the items in PISA here: PISA 2022 student survey item descriptors\n\n\nA useful way to get a quick summary of what is in a data.frame is, the summary command. This command outputs the minimum, median, mean, maximum (and 1st and 3rd quartile values, i.e. the values at 25% and 75% of the range). For example, to get a sense of the science score variable (PV1SCIE) we can use:\n\nsummary(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n    0.0   371.7   444.5   450.5   524.7   895.4"

    "section": "\n5.1 Bar graphs",
    "text": "5.1 Bar graphs\nImagine we want to plot a graph of how many digital devices with screens students report in their home ST253Q01JA in the UK.\nWhen plotting graphs, it makes things easier to have a data.frame of the data you will pass to ggplot - a bit like the final table of data you will actually plot when drawing a graph in real life.\nTo produce the graph, we will first create a new data.frame that we will use in the plot. I have called that data.frame DDplot (it is data on digital devices (DD) we will plot). To do this, take the PISA_2022 data.frame, pipe it, and select ST253Q01JA and CNT and filter for the UK.\nYou have seen piping before. The new element here is using ggplot, one of R’s graphing functions (you can find more details on how to use geom_bar to plot bar graphs, in the section: Geom_bar).\nTo plot a graph, you call ggplot and specify the data you want to use for the graph (in our case, the new data.frame we have created, DDplot).\nThe next layer of ggplot is the aesthetics (aes), i.e., what our graph will look like. First, we tell ggplot what data we want our y axis to represent, in this case the number of students with interactive whiteboards in the item ST253Q01JA . Finally, we specify we want a bar graph using geom_bar().\n\n# Graphing the numbers of digital devices students have\nDDplot &lt;- PISA_2022%&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA)%&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# use DDplot data to create a graph\nggplot(data=DDplot,\n       aes(x=ST253Q01JA)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\nThat is a good first attempt, but there are some aspects we will want to tidy up.\nYou can modify the graph by adding axis labels and titles using xlab(\"label\"), ylab(\"label\"), and ggtitle(\"title\").\n\n# use IWBplot data to create a graph\n# Adding axis labels and a title\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\")+\n  ylab(\"Count\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\")\n\n\n\n\nYou can add colour, by specifying that the fill of the bars should be by the value of IC009Q11NA in the aesthetics: aes(x=IC009Q11NA, fill=IC009Q11NA).\n\n# use IWBplot data to create a graph\n# Adding axis labels and a title\n# And adding colour\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST253Q01JA)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\")+\n  ylab(\"Count\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\")\n\n\n\n\nTo rotate the text on the x-axis you can add the text: +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)). Inserting \\n into the title adds a line break to divide the long title. We can turn the legend off with + theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# use DDplot data to create a graph\n# Adding axis labels and a title\n# And adding colour\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST253Q01JA)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\")+\n  ylab(\"Count\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability \\n of digital devices in the UK\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nYou make wish to plot multiple series, for example, the interactive whiteboard data reported by boys and girls. In that case, we need to include the gender vector ST004D01T in the data frame to plot DDplot. To highlight the difference between boys and girls, in the aesthetics we set the fill colour by the gender variable: fill=ST004D01T. Finally, we need to tell ggplot to plot the bars side-by-side, rather than stacking them - you do this by specifying position = position_dodge2().\n\n# Graphing the number of digital devices students have by gender\n\nDDplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plotting two series - in this case, by gender\n\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_bar(position = position_dodge2())+\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\")+\n  ylab(\"Count\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability \\n of digital devices in the UK\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\nIf you take `position = position_dodge2() out, ggplot will default to stacking the bars. The long response for no devices (\"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\") is not terribly aesthetically pleasing. I will use mutate to change it - recode changes all the \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\" to \"None\" in the vector ST253Q01JA.\n\n# Graphing the number of digital devices students have\nDDplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Changing the longer label for a shorter for ease of plotting\n# Change the long \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens\" to \"None\"\nDDplot&lt;-DDplot%&gt;%\n  mutate(ST253Q01JA = recode(ST253Q01JA, \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\"=\"None\"))\n\n# Plotting two series - in this case, by gender\n\nggplot(data=DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have\")+\n  ylab(\"Count\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\")\n\n\n\n\nYou can add text, for example the counts, to the graphs, using geom_text. We set the label to ..count.. and stat=count. Because the bars have been positioned using position_dodge, you need to do the same for the labels. vjust=-0.5 sets the height of the label over the bar.\n\n# Graphing the number of students who have an interactive whiteboard by gender\nDDplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Changing the longer label for a shorter for ease of plotting\nDDplot&lt;-DDplot%&gt;%\n  mutate(ST253Q01JA = recode(ST253Q01JA, \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\"=\"None\"))\n\n\n# Plotting two series - in this case, by gender with text\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_bar(position = position_dodge2())+\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\")+\n  ylab(\"Count\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\")+\n  geom_text(aes(label=..count..), stat = \"count\", \n            position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size=3)"

    "text": "7.1 Task 1 Binning data\nFrequency plots are often used to show data following a normal distribution, To produce a frequency plot, we need to divide data into counts, each covering a range of data. This is called ‘binning’. There is a choice to be made here, in how large or small to make the divisions (‘bins’) - this can affect how the data looks when graphed.\nFor example, to produce a frequency plot of science scores in the UK, we can first run a summary command on PV1SCIE to find the minimum and maximum score:\n\n# Find the range of science score\nsummary(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n    0.0   371.7   444.5   450.5   524.7   895.4 \n\n\nIf we wanted to plot a frequency chart of heights, we might divide the range of scores (from 0-895.4) into bins of 20 points. To do this we can use the cut(&lt;field&gt;,&lt;breaks&gt;) function within the mutate command on a ‘data.frame’. The &lt;field&gt; specifies the range (i.e. from around 0-900) and &lt;breaks&gt; the size of bins.\nIn the example below, we use cut(PV1SCIE, breaks=seq(0,900,20)) to create a new vector (column in the table) with the total number of pupils divided up into bins. The specification breaks=seq(0,900,20)) sets how the data are divided up - into bins (i.e. groups of respondents) of scores starting at 50 and rising to 900 in steps of 20.\n\n# Creates distribution of science scores\n\nbinnedsize &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% # Creates a new data frame with binned data\n  select(PV1SCIE, CNT)%&gt;% # Select the columns needed\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")%&gt;%\n  mutate(BinnedPV1SCIE = cut(PV1SCIE, breaks=seq(0, 900, 20)))%&gt;%\n  na.omit() # Drop any NAs\n\n# Plot the data as a bar graph\nggplot(binnedsize,\n       aes(x = BinnedPV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"dark green\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(y = \"Number of responses\", x = \"Scores range\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a graph of the binned counts of mathematics scores in Malta.

    "section": "\n7.2 Task 2 Plotting data on maps",
    "text": "7.2 Task 2 Plotting data on maps\nAs well as graphs, R can also plot data onto maps. The geom_map function will plot a map of a region and you can either plot points (using geom_point) or fill regions by drawing a polygon of the shape of that region (using geom_polygon).\nFor example, imagine we created a data frame of the mean science scores of countries in the PISA data:\n\n# Pipe the total data frame and calculate the mean science scores\n# To match with another data frame we will use, we will rename CNT to region\nWorldSci &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(meanSci = mean(PV1SCIE)) %&gt;%\n  rename(region = CNT)\n\nIn order to plot the data onto a map, colouring the countries by science scores, we need data which gives the coordinates of the edges of the countries. This data is available from the map_data function in ggplot. First we load the latitude and longitude data into a new data frame world_data. In the next steps we will then use left_join to combine it with the science data, but we need to tidy the data to match the PISA data, before we can join the two data sets.\n\n# Create a data frame of country latitude and longitude data\nworld_data &lt;- map_data(map = \"world\")\n\nOne quirk of the two data frames (world_data and the PISA data) is that some countries have different names. For example, PISA uses ‘United Kingdom’, but the rworldmap package uses ‘UK’. We can change the names of countries in the PISA data.frame to match those in rworldmap, using the case_when function with mutate. For example, if we want to change all United Kingdom entries to UK we use: mutate(region = case_when(region == \"United Kingdom\" ~ \"UK\". The final part of the case_when sets the default - .default = region - that means if none of the matches are found, then region is set to region - i.e. it is left unchanged.\n\n# The names of two countries in the PISA data frame and world_data data frame don't match (UK/United Kingdom and US/United States). Change the level names in the PISA data to match the world_data\n\n WorldSci &lt;- WorldSci %&gt;%\n   mutate(region = case_when(\n                       region == \"United Kingdom\" ~ \"UK\",\n                       region == \"United States\"  ~ \"USA\",\n                       region == \"Russian Federation\" ~ \"Russia\",\n                       .default = region))\n\nNow that the country names in the two data frames match, we can use left_join to combine them.\n\n# Add the country latitude and longitude data to the PISA scores\n\nWorldSci &lt;- left_join(WorldSci, world_data, by = \"region\")\n\nTo add labels, you can create a data.frame, with only the country names, and their longitudes and latitudes (the mean of the country longitude and latitude), to use as the labels. You can then add geom_text_repelto add the labels. The repel means the labels won’t overlap. Given the number of countries, using geom_text_repel creates a warning that some labels won’t fit.\nTo plot the data, we use ggplot, with the data frame to WorldSci, and the x and y variables set to long and lat, the longitudes and latitudes. We specify that we want to keep the grouping of the data frame (i.e. by country).\nFirst we use geom_map to plot a blank map using the data - this will be the base for the highlighted countries. In the aes we give the longitudes and latitudes, and, as we want a blank map, set the fill to white and the line colour to black.\nFinally, we use geom_polygon to draw coloured shapes, with the fill changing by the value of meanSci. To make the map look nice, I have used a pre-defined colour scale.\n\n# Use geom_map to plot the basic world map (fill is white, line colour is black)\n# Use geom_polygon to plot the PISA data\n# Add a colour scale\nggplot(data = WorldSci, aes(x = long, y = lat, group=group)) +\n  geom_map(data = world_data, \n           map = world_data, \n           aes(map_id = region), \n           fill = \"white\", \n           colour = \"black\")+\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = meanSci)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"viridis\")\n\n\n\n\nIn ggplot, by default, the aesthetics are passed from one layer to the next. In our first aes call we set a grouping (group=group). However, when we come to the labeling function geom_text_repel, the data frame Labels is not grouped. We therefore need to use new aesthetics and want to ignore the original aesthetics (aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group,label=region))) we previously set.\nWe do this with the command inherit.aes = FALSE (i.e. do not inherit the previous aesthetics). Then in geom_text_repel(data=Labels, inherit.aes = FALSE, aes(x=long, y=lat,label=region)) we specify the label data.frame, and in aes pass the positions of the labels (x=long, y=lat) and specify that the labels are in the region vector.\n\nggplot(data = WorldSci, \n       aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,label = region)) +\n  geom_map(data = world_data,\n           map = world_data, \n           aes(map_id = region), \n           fill = \"white\",\n           colour = \"black\")+\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = meanSci)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"viridis\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = Labels,\n                 inherit.aes = FALSE,\n                 aes(x = long, y = lat, label = region))\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot mean PISA mathematics scores on a world map, labelling the countries.\n\n\nAnswer# Create a data.frame of mathematics scores\nWorldMath &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(meanmath = mean(PV1MATH)) %&gt;%\n  rename(region = CNT)\n# The names of two countries in the PISA data frame and world_data data frame don't match (UK/United Kingdom and US/United States).

However, ILSAs only became established and regular in the late 1990s and 2000s.\nThe OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has tested 15-year-old students in a range of “literacies” or “competencies” every three years since 2000. There is a rotating focus on reading, mathematics and science, with PISA 2021 focusing on mathematics but delayed by the global pandemic until 2022 and the results only published in December 2023. Until then, PISA 2018, with a focus on reading, was the most recently available cycle and PISA 2015 remains the most recent cycle focusing on science.\nIn addition to reading, mathematics and science, PISA has tested students on a range of “novel” competencies including problem-solving, global competence, financial literacy, and creative thinking. In addition to these tests, PISA also administers questionnaires to students, teachers and parents to identify “factors” which explain test score differences within and between countries.\nSince 2000, more than 90 “countries and economies” and around 3,000,000 students have participated in PISA. The growth in the number of countries participating in each cycle of PISA is reflected in the growth in the number of students taking the PISA tests and responding to the PISA questionnaires, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Number of students participating in PISA by year\n\n\nYear\nNumber completing assessment\n\n\n\n2000\n265,000\n\n\n2003\n275,000\n\n\n2006\n400,000\n\n\n2009\n470,000\n\n\n2012\n510,000\n\n\n2015\n540,000\n\n\n2018\n600,000\n\n\n2022\n690,000\n\n\n\nThere is a degree of inherent error in all educational and psychological assessments - and indeed in all social or physical measurement. ILSAs such as PISA may be more prone to error because their comparisons across large and diverse populations make them particularly complex. However, it is particularly important to minimise the error in ILSAs because they influence education policy and practice across a large number of education systems, impacting a vast population of students beyond those sampled for the assessments.\nAccording to the OECD (2019), three sources of error are worth considering. First, sampling error, uncertainty in the degree to which results from the sample generalise to the wider population - in 2018, the OECD average sampling error was 0.4 of a PISA point score (the value was not reported for 2022). Second, measurement error, uncertainty in the extent to which test items measure proficiency. In 2018, the measurement error was around 0.8 of a point in mathematics and science and 0.5 of a score point in reading (the measurement error was not reported for 2022). Third, the link error is the uncertainty in comparison between scores in different years. For comparisons of science scores between 2018 and 2015, the link error is 1.5 points. For 2018-2022, the link errors are reading (1.47), mathematics (2.24) and science (1.61) (OECD 2022, 293)\nPISA uses a probabilistic, stratified clustered survey design (Jerrim et al. 2017). However, sampling issues including sample representativeness, non-response rates and population coverage have been identified (Zieger et al. 2022; Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2016; Gillis, Polesel, and Wu 2016; Hopmann, Brinek, and Retzl 2007). Furthermore, Anders et al. (2021) and Jerrim (2021) have shown that assumptions for imputing values (imputing means estimating any missing values based on existing data - for example by adding a mean or mode score for a missing test) for non-participating students used to construct the sample may have significant impacts on achievement scores.\nSince PISA 2015, the majority of participating countries have switched from paper-based assessment to computer-based assessment (Jerrim 2016). A randomised controlled trial conducted by the OECD prior to the switch indicated a difference in score between the two modes of delivery. The OECD introduced an adjustment to compensate for this difference, but it is not entirely removed by the adjustment Jerrim et al. (2018), with implications for any time series comparisons between PISA cycles. Nonetheless, Jerrim (2016) notes that “in terms of cross-country rankings, there remains a high degree of consistency… the vast majority of countries are simply ‘shifted’ by a uniform amount” (pp. 508-509).\nIn summary, comparisons within and between countries and comparisons over time using ILSAs need careful interpretations that bear in mind the specific design of each ILSA. In practice, this means considering a range of potential explanations for score differences. Does a difference in science ranking between two countries simply reflect sampling error? Does the same parental occupation or home possessions amount to the same economic, social and cultural status in different countries (e.g. the social status of a parent as a teacher or the economic status of the number of cars a family owns)? Does a difference in mathematical self-efficacy (i.e. student self-confidence in mathematics) between the USA and Japan reflect sociocultural differences in self-enhancement and modesty, respectively? How do score differences between boys and girls indicate gender inequalities in education that reflect wider society?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor useful critique and discussion of the construction of the measure of socio-economic status in PISA data see: Avvisati’s (2020) paper.\n\n\n\n\nRecall you can use group_by and summarise to group individual student measures and find means and standard deviations for countries. For example, to find the mean wealth scores for the countries, and rank in descending order, we first select the variables of interest CNT and HOMEPOS (home possesions, a proxy for wealth), then group_by CNT and summarise to get the mean. As there are some NA values, we need to include na.rm=TRUE to tell summarise to ignore the missing values. Finally, we arrange in descending order by the new variable we create meanwealth. We can do the same and add a calculation to get the standard deviation.\n\n# Create a data frame of PISA 2022 data of country mean wealth\n\nPISA2022WealthRank &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;% # Select variables of interest\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% # group by country\n  summarise(meanwealth = mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n                    # summarise  country data to find the mean HOMEPOS\n  arrange(desc(meanwealth)) # arrange in descending order based on the \n                            # meanwealth score\nPISA2022WealthRank\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 2\n   CNT         meanwealth\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Norway           0.547\n 2 Australia        0.483\n 3 Korea            0.371\n 4 New Zealand      0.367\n 5 Canada           0.348\n 6 Iceland          0.346\n 7 Sweden           0.327\n 8 Ireland          0.318\n 9 Malta            0.308\n10 Austria          0.280\n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\n# With standard deviations\n\nPISA2022WealthRank &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;% # Select variables of interest\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% # group by country\n  summarise(meanwealth = mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE),  \n            # summarise  country data to find the mean HOMEPOS\n            sdwealth=sd(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # and standard deviation\n  arrange(desc(meanwealth)) \n# arrange in descending order based on the meanwealth score\n\nPISA2022WealthRank\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 3\n   CNT         meanwealth sdwealth\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Norway           0.547    0.970\n 2 Australia        0.483    0.861\n 3 Korea            0.371    1.01 \n 4 New Zealand      0.367    0.862\n 5 Canada           0.348    0.867\n 6 Iceland          0.346    0.805\n 7 Sweden           0.327    0.878\n 8 Ireland          0.318    0.818\n 9 Malta            0.308    0.857\n10 Austria          0.280    0.938\n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\n\n\nRecall you can use geom_bar to plot a bar graph. For example, if we wanted to plot the PISA2022WealthRank data frame we just created, we pass the data to ggplot. Recall that if you are passing geom_bar the exact values you want to plot, rather than making it count (for example, by including the original dataset with all student entries), you need to specify geom_bar(stat='identity')\nI have added +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) which rotates the text on the x-axis.\n\n# Plot a bar graph of wealth by country\n\nggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x = CNT, y = meanwealth))+\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+ # The data are already summarised so add\n                              # stat = 'identity'\n  # rotate the text\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) \n\n\n\n\nWe can improve this plot by reordering the x-axis to rank the countries - we switch x=CNT to x=reorder(CNT, -meanwealth) that is we reorder the x axis based on descending (indicated by the minus sign -meanwealth) meanwealth.\n\n# Plot the wealth data frame as a bar graph, reordering the x axis by wealth\n\nggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x=reorder(CNT, -meanwealth), y = meanwealth)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity') +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, you can add colour, tidy up the axis labels, and give a title:\n\n# Plot the wealth data frame as a bar graph, reordering the x axis by wealth\n\nggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x = reorder(CNT, -meanwealth), \n                               y = meanwealth))+\n  geom_bar(stat='identity', fill = \"skyblue\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+\n  ggtitle(\"Countries ranked by HOMEPOS\")+ # Add a title\n  xlab(\"Country\")+ # Add axis lables\n  ylab(\"Mean HOMEPOS\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot a scatter plot, recall we use geom_point. For example, to plot reading scores against mathematics scores in the UK we: a) create a data set of reading and science scores after filtering for UK; b) pass the data to ggplot; c) use aes to specify the x and y variables and d) plot with geom_point().\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\nggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThat graph is quite dense, so we can use the alpha function to make the points slightly transparent, size to make them smaller, and set their colour. I will also tidy up the axis names and add a line (note that in: geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\") method = \"lm\" sets the line to a straight (i.e., linear model, lm) line).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\nggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 0.1, colour = \"red\") + \n  # change opacity (alpha), size and colour of points\n  xlab(\"Reading score\") + # Add labels\n  ylab(\"Science score\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\") # Add a line of best fit\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative type of plot is the density plot, which is a kind of continuous histogram. The density plot can be useful for visualising the achievement scores of students. For example, the mathematics scores of girls and boys (recall the gender variable is ST004D01T) in the US. We use na.omit to omit NAs. Notice, for the plot, I use aes to set my x variable, and then specify that the plot should fill by gender (fill=ST004D01T). Finally, in geom_density(alpha=0.6) I set the alpha to 0.6 to make the fill areas partially transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe y-axis on a density plot is chosen so that the total area under the graph adds up to 1\n\n\n\n# Create a data.frame of US Math data including gender\n\nUSMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United States\") %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n# PLot a density chart, seeting the fill by gender, and setting the opacity to\n# 0.6 to show both gender plots\n\nggplot(USMathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\nA powerful feature of ggplot is being able to produce the same graph for multiple values of a variable, for example, for multiple countries. For example, we may want to produce the density graph of PV1MATH score by gender, for several countries in the data set. To do that, we produce a data set of PV1MATH scores, and gender (ST004D01T) and filter for four countries (Philippines, UK, Bulgaria and Germany). We use the same code as above to plot the graphs but add +facet_wrap(.~CNT) - facet_wrap tells ggplot to produce a multi-panel plot and .~CNT means do the same as above (the . means, as above), but vary across countries (~CNT).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the math scores for the 4 countries\nMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Philippines\"|CNT == \"United Kingdom\"|CNT == \"Bulgaria\" |\n           CNT == \"Germany\")\n\n# Plot the data, changing colour by gender, and faceting for the countries\n\nggplot(Mathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ CNT)\n\n\n\n\n\nA useful analytical choice is to categorise some a numerical variable into ordinal classes. For example, rather than treating HOMEPOS as a continuous scale, you might want to split into high and low wealth groups (for example, those above and below the mean value).\nTo do this, first calculate the mean mean(HOMEPOS). Then we add a new vector, which we will call wealthclass using the mutate function. We set the value of wealthclass using ifelse. If HOMEPOS is more than the mean score, we set wealthclass to High, and if it is anything else, we set it to Low. We do that using wealthclass = ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth, \"High\", \"Low\"). Note, in ifelse, the first value is returned if the identity is true (i.e. if HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth wealthclass is set to High). If the value if not true, the second value is set (e.g. if HOMEPOS is not &gt; MeanUKwealth then wealthclass is set to LOW)\nFor example, create a data frame of UK participants HOMEPOS sorted into HIGH and LOW categories.\n\n# Create a data frame of UK responses\nUKPISA2022 &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(wealthclass =  ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm=TRUE), \n                               \"High\", # mutate to create a new column\n                               \"Low\")) # wealthclass - if HOMEPOS is more\n                                       # than mean(HOMEPOS) set the column to\n                                       # \"High\" otherwise set it to \"Low\"\nUKPISA2022\n\n# A tibble: 12,972 × 3\n   CNT            HOMEPOS wealthclass\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 United Kingdom  -1.09  Low        \n 2 United Kingdom  -0.418 Low        \n 3 United Kingdom   1.13  High       \n 4 United Kingdom  -0.829 Low        \n 5 United Kingdom  -0.274 Low        \n 6 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 7 United Kingdom  -0.606 Low        \n 8 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 9 United Kingdom   0.425 High       \n10 United Kingdom   0.998 High       \n# ℹ 12,962 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss the design features of PISA (for example, sampling, forms of tests etc.) and the sources of error that arise from them.\nAs researchers, what issues should we bear in mind when interpreting the data?

In ggplot you specify the data, and then in aes set the x-value (the variable of interest, and set the fill to change by different groups). Within the geom_density call you can specify the alpha, the opacity of the plot.\nFor example, to plot science scores in the UK by gender, you would use the code below:\n\n# Create a data frame of UK science scores including gender\n\nUKSci&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the density chart, changing colour by gender, and setting the alpha (opacity) to 0.5\nggplot(data = UKSci,\n       aes(x = PV1SCIE, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the answer# Create a data frame of UK and Japanese mathematics scores\n\nJPUKMath&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\"|CNT == \"Japan\")\n\n# Plot the density chart, changing colour by country, and setting the alpha (opacity) to 0.5\nggplot(data = JPUKMath,\n       aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = CNT)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine gender differences: Plot the distributions of mathematics achievement in the UK by gender.

For more than two categories, you can use nested ifelses. In the example below, if the math score is more than 400, you go to the second ifelse to check if it is over 500. If both ifelses (over 400 and over 500) are met, the score is categorised as “Very High”. If the score is between 400 and 500, the first ifelse is met, but not the second, so the else condition of the second is met and the score set to “High”. If neither condition is met, the MATHSCORECAT is set to “Low”.\n\n\nShow the answer# Create a data frame for the UK and Germany\n# Mutate the WTHCTG (wealth category) column by the boundaries of wealth categories\nWealth &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" | CNT == \"Germany\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(WTHCTG = ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; 0, \n                       ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; 1,\n                             \"Very high\",\n                             \"High\"), \n                       \"Low\"))%&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nggplot(data = Wealth, \n       aes(x = WTHCTG, fill = WTHCTG))+\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)+\n  xlab(\"Wealth grouping\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot scatter plots of science versus mathematics achievement in United Kingdom, Qatar and Brazil • What differences can you see between the countries?\n\n\nShow the answer# Create a data frame of science and mathematics scores, across the countries Including gender)\n\nSciMaths &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Colombia\" | CNT == \"New Zealand\" | CNT == \"Qatar\"|\n           CNT == \"Israel\") %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\n# Scatter plot the data, faceting by country\n\nggplot(data = SciMaths, \n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE, colour = ST004D01T))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)\n\n\n\nShow the answer# Low achieving (filter for scores less than 400)\n\nSciMaths &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Colombia\" | CNT == \"New Zealand\" | CNT == \"Qatar\"|\n           CNT == \"Israel\") %&gt;%\n  filter(PV1MATH &lt; 400)%&gt;%\n  filter(PV1SCIE &lt; 400)%&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nggplot(data = SciMaths, \n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE, colour = ST004D01T))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)"

    "text": "The first International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) comparing the learning outcomes of school students between countries was attempted in the 1960s. However, ILSAs only became established and regular in the late 1990s and 2000s.\nThe OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has tested 15-year-old students in a range of “literacies” or “competencies” every three years since 2000. There is a rotating focus on reading, mathematics and science, with PISA 2021 focusing on mathematics but delayed by the global pandemic until 2022 and the results only published in December 2023. Until then, PISA 2018, with a focus on reading, was the most recently available cycle and PISA 2015 remains the most recent cycle focusing on science.\nIn addition to reading, mathematics and science, PISA has tested students on a range of “novel” competencies including problem-solving, global competence, financial literacy, and creative thinking. In addition to these tests, PISA also administers questionnaires to students, teachers and parents to identify “factors” which explain test score differences within and between countries.\nSince 2000, more than 90 “countries and economies” and around 3,000,000 students have participated in PISA. The growth in the number of countries participating in each cycle of PISA is reflected in the growth in the number of students taking the PISA tests and responding to the PISA questionnaires, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Number of students participating in PISA by year\n\n\nYear\nNumber completing assessment\n\n\n\n2000\n265,000\n\n\n2003\n275,000\n\n\n2006\n400,000\n\n\n2009\n470,000\n\n\n2012\n510,000\n\n\n2015\n540,000\n\n\n2018\n600,000\n\n\n2022\n690,000\n\n\n\nThere is a degree of inherent error in all educational and psychological assessments - and indeed in all social or physical measurement. ILSAs such as PISA may be more prone to error because their comparisons across large and diverse populations make them particularly complex. However, it is particularly important to minimise the error in ILSAs because they influence education policy and practice across a large number of education systems, impacting a vast population of students beyond those sampled for the assessments.\nAccording to the OECD (2019), three sources of error are worth considering. First, sampling error, uncertainty in the degree to which results from the sample generalise to the wider population - in 2018, the OECD average sampling error was 0.4 of a PISA point score (the value was not reported for 2022). Second, measurement error, uncertainty in the extent to which test items measure proficiency. In 2018, the measurement error was around 0.8 of a point in mathematics and science and 0.5 of a score point in reading (the measurement error was not reported for 2022). Third, the link error is the uncertainty in comparison between scores in different years. For comparisons of science scores between 2018 and 2015, the link error is 1.5 points. For 2018-2022, the link errors are reading (1.47), mathematics (2.24) and science (1.61) (OECD 2022, 293)\nPISA uses a probabilistic, stratified clustered survey design (Jerrim et al. 2017). However, sampling issues including sample representativeness, non-response rates and population coverage have been identified (Zieger et al. 2022; Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2016; Gillis, Polesel, and Wu 2016; Hopmann, Brinek, and Retzl 2007). Furthermore, Anders et al. (2021) and Jerrim (2021) have shown that assumptions for imputing values (imputing means estimating any missing values based on existing data - for example by adding a mean or mode score for a missing test) for non-participating students used to construct the sample may have significant impacts on achievement scores.\nSince PISA 2015, the majority of participating countries have switched from paper-based assessment to computer-based assessment (Jerrim 2016). A randomised controlled trial conducted by the OECD prior to the switch indicated a difference in score between the two modes of delivery. The OECD introduced an adjustment to compensate for this difference, but it is not entirely removed by the adjustment Jerrim et al. (2018), with implications for any time series comparisons between PISA cycles. Nonetheless, Jerrim (2016) notes that “in terms of cross-country rankings, there remains a high degree of consistency… the vast majority of countries are simply ‘shifted’ by a uniform amount” (pp. 508-509).\nIn summary, comparisons within and between countries and comparisons over time using ILSAs need careful interpretations that bear in mind the specific design of each ILSA. In practice, this means considering a range of potential explanations for score differences. Does a difference in science ranking between two countries simply reflect sampling error? Does the same parental occupation or home possessions amount to the same economic, social and cultural status in different countries (e.g. the social status of a parent as a teacher or the economic status of the number of cars a family owns)? Does a difference in mathematical self-efficacy (i.e. student self-confidence in mathematics) between the USA and Japan reflect sociocultural differences in self-enhancement and modesty, respectively? How do score differences between boys and girls indicate gender inequalities in education that reflect wider society?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor useful critique and discussion of the construction of the measure of socio-economic status in PISA data see: Avvisati’s (2020) paper."

    "text": "Recall you can use group_by and summarise to group individual student measures and find means and standard deviations for countries. For example, to find the mean wealth scores for the countries, and rank in descending order, we first select the variables of interest CNT and HOMEPOS (home possesions, a proxy for wealth), then group_by CNT and summarise to get the mean. As there are some NA values, we need to include na.rm=TRUE to tell summarise to ignore the missing values. Finally, we arrange in descending order by the new variable we create meanwealth. We can do the same and add a calculation to get the standard deviation.\n\n# Create a data frame of PISA 2022 data of country mean wealth\n\nPISA2022WealthRank &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;% # Select variables of interest\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% # group by country\n  summarise(meanwealth = mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n                    # summarise  country data to find the mean HOMEPOS\n  arrange(desc(meanwealth)) # arrange in descending order based on the \n                            # meanwealth score\nPISA2022WealthRank\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 2\n   CNT         meanwealth\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Norway           0.547\n 2 Australia        0.483\n 3 Korea            0.371\n 4 New Zealand      0.367\n 5 Canada           0.348\n 6 Iceland          0.346\n 7 Sweden           0.327\n 8 Ireland          0.318\n 9 Malta            0.308\n10 Austria          0.280\n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\n# With standard deviations\n\nPISA2022WealthRank &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;% # Select variables of interest\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% # group by country\n  summarise(meanwealth = mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE),  \n            # summarise  country data to find the mean HOMEPOS\n            sdwealth=sd(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # and standard deviation\n  arrange(desc(meanwealth)) \n# arrange in descending order based on the meanwealth score\n\nPISA2022WealthRank\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 3\n   CNT         meanwealth sdwealth\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Norway           0.547    0.970\n 2 Australia        0.483    0.861\n 3 Korea            0.371    1.01 \n 4 New Zealand      0.367    0.862\n 5 Canada           0.348    0.867\n 6 Iceland          0.346    0.805\n 7 Sweden           0.327    0.878\n 8 Ireland          0.318    0.818\n 9 Malta            0.308    0.857\n10 Austria          0.280    0.938\n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\n\n\nRecall you can use geom_bar to plot a bar graph. For example, if we wanted to plot the PISA2022WealthRank data frame we just created, we pass the data to ggplot. Recall that if you are passing geom_bar the exact values you want to plot, rather than making it count (for example, by including the original dataset with all student entries), you need to specify geom_bar(stat='identity')\nI have added +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) which rotates the text on the x-axis.\n\n# Plot a bar graph of wealth by country\n\nggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x = CNT, y = meanwealth))+\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+ # The data are already summarised so add\n                              # stat = 'identity'\n  # rotate the text\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) \n\n\n\n\nWe can improve this plot by reordering the x-axis to rank the countries - we switch x=CNT to x=reorder(CNT, -meanwealth) that is we reorder the x axis based on descending (indicated by the minus sign -meanwealth) meanwealth.\n\n# Plot the wealth data frame as a bar graph, reordering the x axis by wealth\n\nggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x=reorder(CNT, -meanwealth), y = meanwealth)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity') +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, you can add colour, tidy up the axis labels, and give a title:\n\n# Plot the wealth data frame as a bar graph, reordering the x axis by wealth\n\nggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x = reorder(CNT, -meanwealth), \n                               y = meanwealth))+\n  geom_bar(stat='identity', fill = \"skyblue\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+\n  ggtitle(\"Countries ranked by HOMEPOS\")+ # Add a title\n  xlab(\"Country\")+ # Add axis lables\n  ylab(\"Mean HOMEPOS\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot a scatter plot, recall we use geom_point. For example, to plot reading scores against mathematics scores in the UK we: a) create a data set of reading and science scores after filtering for UK; b) pass the data to ggplot; c) use aes to specify the x and y variables and d) plot with geom_point().\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\nggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThat graph is quite dense, so we can use the alpha function to make the points slightly transparent, size to make them smaller, and set their colour. I will also tidy up the axis names and add a line (note that in: geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\") method = \"lm\" sets the line to a straight (i.e., linear model, lm) line).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\nggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 0.1, colour = \"red\") + \n  # change opacity (alpha), size and colour of points\n  xlab(\"Reading score\") + # Add labels\n  ylab(\"Science score\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\") # Add a line of best fit\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative type of plot is the density plot, which is a kind of continuous histogram. The density plot can be useful for visualising the achievement scores of students. For example, the mathematics scores of girls and boys (recall the gender variable is ST004D01T) in the US. We use na.omit to omit NAs. Notice, for the plot, I use aes to set my x variable, and then specify that the plot should fill by gender (fill=ST004D01T). Finally, in geom_density(alpha=0.6) I set the alpha to 0.6 to make the fill areas partially transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe y-axis on a density plot is chosen so that the total area under the graph adds up to 1\n\n\n\n# Create a data.frame of US Math data including gender\n\nUSMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United States\") %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n# PLot a density chart, seeting the fill by gender, and setting the opacity to\n# 0.6 to show both gender plots\n\nggplot(USMathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\nA powerful feature of ggplot is being able to produce the same graph for multiple values of a variable, for example, for multiple countries. For example, we may want to produce the density graph of PV1MATH score by gender, for several countries in the data set. To do that, we produce a data set of PV1MATH scores, and gender (ST004D01T) and filter for four countries (Philippines, UK, Bulgaria and Germany). We use the same code as above to plot the graphs but add +facet_wrap(.~CNT) - facet_wrap tells ggplot to produce a multi-panel plot and .~CNT means do the same as above (the . means, as above), but vary across countries (~CNT).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the math scores for the 4 countries\nMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Philippines\"|CNT == \"United Kingdom\"|CNT == \"Bulgaria\" |\n           CNT == \"Germany\")\n\n# Plot the data, changing colour by gender, and faceting for the countries\n\nggplot(Mathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ CNT)\n\n\n\n\n\nA useful analytical choice is to categorise some a numerical variable into ordinal classes. For example, rather than treating HOMEPOS as a continuous scale, you might want to split into high and low wealth groups (for example, those above and below the mean value).\nTo do this, first calculate the mean mean(HOMEPOS). Then we add a new vector, which we will call wealthclass using the mutate function. We set the value of wealthclass using ifelse. If HOMEPOS is more than the mean score, we set wealthclass to High, and if it is anything else, we set it to Low. We do that using wealthclass = ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth, \"High\", \"Low\"). Note, in ifelse, the first value is returned if the identity is true (i.e. if HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth wealthclass is set to High). If the value if not true, the second value is set (e.g. if HOMEPOS is not &gt; MeanUKwealth then wealthclass is set to LOW)\nFor example, create a data frame of UK participants HOMEPOS sorted into HIGH and LOW categories.\n\n# Create a data frame of UK responses\nUKPISA2022 &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(wealthclass =  ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm=TRUE), \n                               \"High\", # mutate to create a new column\n                               \"Low\")) # wealthclass - if HOMEPOS is more\n                                       # than mean(HOMEPOS) set the column to\n                                       # \"High\" otherwise set it to \"Low\"\nUKPISA2022\n\n# A tibble: 12,972 × 3\n   CNT            HOMEPOS wealthclass\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 United Kingdom  -1.09  Low        \n 2 United Kingdom  -0.418 Low        \n 3 United Kingdom   1.13  High       \n 4 United Kingdom  -0.829 Low        \n 5 United Kingdom  -0.274 Low        \n 6 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 7 United Kingdom  -0.606 Low        \n 8 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 9 United Kingdom   0.425 High       \n10 United Kingdom   0.998 High       \n# ℹ 12,962 more rows"

Typically, this is set to 0.05, or 5%, but in other cases it might be as high as 0.1 or as low as 0.01 or 0.001 depending on the circumstances. Therefore, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 we accept the null hypothesis and if it less than 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\nWhen considering the number of tails, we then need to consider the p-value here also. If we set the overall probability to be 0.05 for the threshold that we reject the null hypothesis, then for a one-tailed test we compare our result with 0.05. However, with a two-tailed test, since we are looking at a two-tailed test, then the probability of each of the tails is 0.025 and therefore we compare our value with 0.025 instead.\nConventionally, we use 0.05 (1 in 20) as the cut off for statistical significance (a convention that has been much critiqued e.g. (Cohen 1994; Baker 2016))."

This value is usually a known population mean or a theoretical population mean depending on the context of the test.\nFor a two-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean ≠ population mean.\n\nFor a one-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows (depending on the direction of the test)\nEither,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean &gt; population mean.\n\nOr,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean &lt; population mean.\n\nExample: Are Females’ Reading Scores in the UK the Same or Different on Average to the UK Average?\nLet’s look at an example of where we might want to consider a sample, in this case females’ reading scores in the UK, with a presumed population mean, the average reading score in the UK. This is a presumed mean, since we don’t know the true population mean here, but we do know the average reading score from the PISA data, which is 494 (taken from PISA 2022).\nFollowing the steps for performing a hypothesis test, we will start by selecting the appropriate test. Since we are comparing the mean of one sample with a population mean, then we need to use a one sample t-test.\nFirst, you will need to load the PISA data:\n\n# Load PISA Data\nPISA_2022 &lt;- read_parquet(r\"[add the link to your data file]\")\n\nTo ensure we can use this test we need to make sure the conditions are met. Since PISA tests are constructed in a way which means they are normally distributed, then it is likely our sample is also normally distributed. However, it is good practice to check the distribution using a histogram (or qqplot) at the very least, and where appropriate, a normality test. Due to the large sample size normality testing isn’t usually required, so we will just consider a histogram (or qqplot) here.\n\n# Define PISA UK Girls Dataset\nPISA_2022_Read_Girls &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" & ST004D01T == \"Female\")\n\n# Plot histogram\nggplot(data=PISA_2022_Read_Girls,\n       aes(x=PV1READ)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill=\"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the histogram that the sample is approximately normally distributed (as it follows a bell shaped curve).\nNext, we state the null and alternative hypotheses. Since we are determining whether the average reading score is the same or different, we are using a two-tailed test. This gives us the following hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis: mean reading score for females in UK = mean reading score in UK\nAlternative hypothesis: mean reading score for females in UK ≠ mean reading score in UK\n\nHaving set up the hypotheses, we now need to calculate the probability of the null hypothesis being true. To do this, we use R’s t.test function and compare the scores for females in reading in the UK with the OECD average score for reading, which is defined as 476 (OECD website).\n\nOECD_ave_read_UK &lt;-(476)\nt.test(PISA_2022_Read_Girls$PV1READ, mu=OECD_ave_read_UK)\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  PISA_2022_Read_Girls$PV1READ\nt = 19.064, df = 6396, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 476\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 497.7143 502.6918\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n  500.203 \n\n\nWe can see from the result that we get a p-value of &lt; 2.2e-16, which is very small. As this is lower than 0.025 (for a two-tailed test) we reject the null hypothesis.\nTherefore, we accept the null hypothesis that the average reading score for females in the UK is different to the overall average reading score in the UK. Looking at the average stated in the t-test, the average score is higher for girls, at 500.23."

It can also be used for comparing a pair of measurements taken of the same individuals or objects.\nFor a two-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean of first group = sample mean of second group;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean of first group ≠ sample mean of second group.\n\nFor a one-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows (depending on the direction of the test)\nEither,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean of first group = sample mean of second group;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean of first group &gt; sample mean of second group.\n\nOr,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean of first group = sample mean of second group;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean of first group &lt; sample mean of second group.\n\nExample: Are there differences between science and maths scores on average in the UK?\nLet’s say we want to compare the science and maths scores of students in the UK to see if there is a difference in their average score or not.\nFollowing the steps for performing a hypothesis test, we will start by selecting the appropriate test. Since we are comparing the means of two, related samples (since they are two measurements of the same students, therefore related) then we use a paired t-test.\nAgain, we need to check if the groups are approximately normally distributed so check the histogram of each group.\n\n# Create a US maths subsets\nUKMATH&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH,ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\nUKSCIENCE&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T)%&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot histogram\nggplot(data = UKMATH,\n       aes(x = PV1MATH)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n\nggplot(data = UKSCIENCE,\n       aes(x = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we can see the two samples are approximately distributed so can use the t-test.\nNext, we state the null and alternative hypotheses. Since we are determining whether the average maths score is the same or different to the average science score, we are using a two-tailed test. This gives us the following hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis: mean maths score in UK = mean science score in UK\nAlternative hypothesis: mean maths score in UK ≠ mean science score in UK\n\nHaving set up the hypotheses, we now need to calculate the probability of the null hypothesis being true. Again, we use R’s t.test function and compare the average maths scores with the average science scores.\n\n# Perform a two-sided, paired t-test\nt.test(UKMATH$PV1MATH, UKSCIENCE$PV1SCIE, \n       paired = TRUE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  UKMATH$PV1MATH and UKSCIENCE$PV1SCIE\nt = -21.651, df = 12971, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -10.602602  -8.842174\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      -9.722388 \n\n\nWe return a p-value of &lt; 2.2e-16, which is less than 0.025 (for a two-tailed test), meaning we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the average score in maths and science.\nTherefore, we accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference in scores in maths and science in the UK. This difference is approximately 1.5 points.\n::: call-out tip\nIn R, there are often multiple ways of doing the same tests. Note with t.test there are two forms you can use, depending on the format of the data you want to test.\nFirst, in the example above, we had two data frames, for math scores, and science scores, so we can pass two data frames to t.test.\n\n# Carry out a two-sided, paired t-test\nt.test(UKMATH$PV1MATH, UKSCIENCE$PV1SCIE, \n       paired = TRUE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  UKMATH$PV1MATH and UKSCIENCE$PV1SCIE\nt = -21.651, df = 12971, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -10.602602  -8.842174\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      -9.722388 \n\n\nAlternatively, our data might be in one data frame, with a variable indicating the two groups. For example, if we wanted to perform a test of UK science scores, we might create a single data frame in which the two groups are indicated by the column ST004D01T, gender. In that case, we can use the ~ operator to do a t.test on the PISAUK$PV1SCIE (i.e. the science scores) by (~) gender.\n\nUKSci&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT==\"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot a two-sided, unpaired t-test\nt.test(UKSci$PV1SCIE ~ ST004D01T, data = UKSci,\n       paired = FALSE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  UKSci$PV1SCIE by ST004D01T\nt = -3.9298, df = 12964, p-value = 8.547e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Female and group Male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -10.553500  -3.529142\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Female   mean in group Male \n            488.6962             495.7375 \n\n\n:::"

    "text": "3.1 Eta-squared\nNow knowing that there are significant differences between the two class groups, we can next determine how much variation in the test score is explained by class. To do this we calculate a variable called eta-squared.\nEta-squared gives the proportion of variance explained by each variable. The eta squared function is in the package lsr so we will install lsr, and then use the result of our anova (resaov) to calculate the eta squared variable using the function etaSquared. To report the value of eta as a percentage we need to multiply the output of eta by 100.\nEta squared tells us the proportion of the total variance that is explained by a variable (you can also think of it as an effect size). An eta squared value of 1 indicates all the variance of a sample is explain by some variable and 0 means the variable is not responsible for any of the observed variance. We can multiply the eta-squared score by 100 to get a value for the percentage of variance explained.\nThe percentage of variance explained is a useful figure. For example, it has been reported that schools only account for 14% of the variance in progress 8 scores, whilst family explains 43% (Wilkinson, Bryson, and Stokes (2018)).\n\nlibrary(lsr)\neta &lt;- as.data.frame(etaSquared(resaov))\neta &lt;- eta*100\neta\n\n      eta.sq eta.sq.part\nCNT 28.45522    28.45522\n\n\nThe important column here is the eta.sq column - it tells us that the country explains 28% of the variance in test scores.

For example, if the anova reports statistically significant differences by age, statistically significant differences might exist between 11, 12 and 13-year old students, but not between 13 and 14-year olds.\nWe can use an additional anova test, Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference test (or Tukey’s HSD for short), to find out which pairs of subgroups have statistically significant differences in means.\nConsider the question: Are there statistically significant differences in the variance of science scores of the UK, US, France and Germany?

About 70-80% of state schools respond to this census. It provides information on taught hours of subject, staffing levels and democgraphics and school vacancies.\n\nget-information-schools school provider information\nONS SRS restricted datasets, see below.\n\n\n1 Students\nStudent exclusions and suspensions datasets here\nSecondary and primary school applications here\n\n2 Schools\nEducation provider details, also known as edubase can be found here. This dataset includes a live snapshot about all ~40,000 providers, current and historic, including name, school type, headteacher details, geographic location etc. Current Ofsted results.\nTo get a yearly snapshot of providers including their Oftsed grade, Progress 8 score, EAL %, Pupil Premium % etc. you can use the School performance tables, in particular the download data area. You can select a year and then choose the data to suit your needs. The options you are presented with might appear a little overlapping, it’s worth downloading a few files to see which best suit your needs, for example:\n\n\nSchool information high level data on the name, location and type of school.\n\nKey stage 4 results (final) school level results and demographic details, e.g. pupil premium %, EBACC and Progress 8.\n\nKey stage 4 qualification and subject data (final) subject level data for schools, including number of entries and results for each subject in each school.\n\nWhen downloading the data, you will be faced by a wall of acronyms some might make sense: AGELOW, AGEHIGH, others might be a little more confusing: TPUP, TPRIORHI.

You can download year on year datasets here, with data going back to 2014/15\n\n3 School workforce\nThe DfE published a yearly snapshot on the workforce in schools. This data is taken from school workforce and gives information on teachers, vacancies, timetabling.\n\n4 Restricted datasets\nThe DfE maintains several restricted datasets that concerns sensitive data about students and teachers. The two main datasets are the National Pupil Database and the School Workforce Census datasets. These datasets contain data including demographic indicators, results, degree qualifications and pay. To gain access to these datasets you need to complete a rather onerous process to justify your need for the data and your ability to work safely with it. Data is hosted by the Office of National Statistics through their Secure Research Service (SRS), an online platform where you can safely analyse data using R, Stata, Python, SPSS etc. To gain access to this system researchers will need to get ONS accreditation, this process is free, but can take some time to arrange. The SRS offers several routes to access the data:\n\n\nsafe rooms, dedicated research sites hosted by the ONS or other provider, e.g. a university (you won’t be allowed to bring mobile phones or laptop into this sites, nor will you be able to remove any notes you take while undertaking research)\n\nsecure rooms, rooms within your institution that have been cleared to access the SRS. You’ll need to justify that this room is safe, e.g. single use room, no one overlooking you whilst working, locked door to the room, dedicated IP address linked to a networked physical socket not a WiFi connection.\n\nMore recently, due to the pandemic, VPN access has been allowed to the SRS. Requests for VPN access need to be made to the DfE and the ONS.\nAdditionally, the DfE have been working on the LEO dataset, a longitudinal dataset matching student outcomes to national insurance data on earnings. LEO is also accessed through the SRS."
