    "text": "1.1 Seminar tasks\n\n1.1.1 Activity 1: The mismeasure of man?\n\n’The Mismeasure of Man treats one particular form of quantified claim about the ranking of human groups: the argument that intelligence can be meaningfully abstracted as a single number capable of ranking all people on a linear scale of intrinsic and unalterable mental worth.\n… this limited subject embodies the deepest (and most common) philosophical error, with the most fundamental and far-ranging social impact, for the entire troubling subject of nature and nurture, or the genetic contribution to human social organization.’ Gould (1996), p. ii\n\nDiscuss:\n• To what extent do the variables commonly studied in educational research (for example, intelligence, exam scores, attitudes etc.) validly represent some underlying latent variable?\n• What advantages does quantification of such variables bring, and what issues does it raise?\n• Can you think of an example in your own practice where a variable has been created that doesn’t fully reflect the latent concept?\n• What is the researcher’s role in making sure variables are validly represented?\n\n1.1.2 Activity 2: An example of quantification\nIn the seminar we will consider this paper:\nPasha-Zaidi, N., & Afari, E. (2016). Gender in STEM education: An exploratory study of student perceptions of math and science instructors in the United Arab Emirates. International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 14(7), 1215-1231.\nPasha-Zaidi and Afari (2016)\nReflect on\n\nWhat potential issues arise from the authors’ construction of quantitative variables of ‘teacher professionalism’ and ‘teacher warmth’?\nTo what extent does the authors’ survey validly probe the variables of ‘teacher professionalism’ and ‘teacher warmth’?\nWhat other critiques of the study can you propose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Activity 3: A false dualism?\n\n“‘Quantitative’ and ‘qualitative’ are frequently seen in opposition…. The contrast is drawn between the objective world (out there independently of our thinking about it) and the subjective worlds (in our heads, as it were, and individually constructed); between the public discourse and private meanings; between reality unconstructed by anyone and the ‘multiple realities’ constructed by each individual. The tendency to dichotomise in this way is understandable but misleading.” (Pring 2000, 248)\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhat are the differing assumptions of qualitative and quantitative educational research?\nAre the two ‘paradigms’ completely distinct? Is the distinction helpful?\nHow should a researcher choose what approach to use?\n\n1.1.4 Task 4: Another critique of quantification\nThe second task considers this paper: Gibson and Dembo (1984)\nFor the purpose of discussion, teacher efficacy has been defined as “the extent to which the teacher believes he or she has the capacity to affect student performance” (Berman et al. 1977, 137)\nTool\n\n\n\n\n(Gibson and Dembo 1984, 573)\nFindings\n\n(Gibson and Dembo 1984, 577)\nTo discuss\n\nDoes teacher efficacy measure a discrete aspect of teachers’ beliefs? Does that matter?\nDoes the construct have validity? I.e., does the questionnaire measure what it claims to?\nWhat issues arises from quantifying teacher efficacy?\nWhat alternatives are there to quantitative measures of teacher efficacy? What are their advantages and limitations?"

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nThis short course aims to take you through the process of writing your first programs in the R statistical programming language to analyse national and international educational datasets. To do this we will be using the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE), a desktop application to support you in writing R scripts. R Studio supports your programming by flagging up errors in your code as you write it, and helping you manage your analysis environment by giving you quick access to tables, objects and graphs as you develop them. In addition, we will be looking at data analysis using the tidyverse code packages. The tidyverse is a standardised collection of supporting code that helps you read data, tidy it into a usable format, analyse it and present your findings.\nThe R programming language offers similar functionality to an application based statistical tool such as SPSS, with more of a focus on you writing code to solve your problems, rather than using prebuilt tools. R is open source, meaning that it is free to use and that lots of people have written code in R that they have shared with others. R statistical libraries are some of the most comprehensive in existence. R is popular1 in academia and industry, being used for everything from sales modelling to cancer detection.\n\n# This example shows how R can pull data directly from the internet\n# tidy it and start making graphs. All within 9 lines of code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\neducation <- read_csv(\n  \"https://barrolee.github.io/BarroLeeDataSet/BLData/BL_v3_MF.csv\")\n\neducation %>%\n  filter(agefrom == 15, ageto == 24,\n         country %in% c(\"Germany\",\"France\",\"Italy\",\"United Kingdom\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=yr_sch, colour=country)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\nWhilst it is possible to use R through menu systems and drop down tools, the focus of this course is for you to write your own R scripts. These are text files that will tell the computer how to go through the process of loading, cleaning, analysing and presenting data. The sequential and modular nature of these files makes it very easy to develop and test each stage separately, reuse code in the future, and share with others.\nThis booklet is written with the following sections to support you:\n\n# Code examples and questions appear like this\na <- 1 + 3\n\n[1] Code output appears like this\nCourier font indicates keyboard presses, column names, column values and function names.\n<folder> Courier font within brackets describe values that can be passed to functions and that you need to define yourself.

    "section": "\n2.4 Your first program",
    "text": "2.4 Your first program\n\n2.4.1 Objects and instructions\nIn programming languages we can attach data to a name, this is called assigning a value to an object (you might also call them variables). To do this in R we use the <- arrow command. For example, I want to put the word \"Pete\" into an object called myname (note that words and sentences such as \"Pete\" need speech marks):\n\nmyname <- \"Pete\"\nprint(myname)\n\n[1] \"Pete\"\n\n\nWe can also perform quick calculations and assign them to objects:\n\nHoursInYear <- 365 * 24\nprint(HoursInYear) \n\n[1] 8760\n\n\n\nType the two examples above into your RStudio script file and check that they work. Adapt them to say your full name and give the number of MinutesInADay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember to select code and press control or command and Enter to run it\n\n\nObjects can form part of calculations, for example, the code below shows how we can use the number HoursInYear to (roughly!) calculate the number of HoursInWeek:\n\nHoursInYear <- 365 * 24\n\nHoursInWeek <- HoursInYear / 52\nprint(HoursInWeek)\n\n[1] 168.4615\n\n\nNotice from the above we can perform the main arithmetic commands using keyboard symbols: + (add); - (minus); * (multiply); / (divide); ^ (power)\nObjects can change values when you run code. For example in the code below:\n\na <- 2000\nb <- 5\n\na <- b\n\na <- a * b\nprint(a)\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nWhat’s going on here?\n\nline 1 sets a to equal 2000 (note: don’t use commas in writing numbers a <- 2,000 would bring up an error),\nline 2 sets b to equal 5,\nline 4 overwrites the value of a with the value stored in b, making object a now equal to 5\nline six is now 5 * 5\n\n\n\n2.4.1.1 Questions\n\nwhat are the outputs of the following code snippets/what do they do? One of the examples might not output anything, why is that? Type the code into your script file to check your answers:\ncode example 1\n\nrabbits <- 50\nfeet <- 4\n\ntotalfeet <- rabbits * feet\nprint(totalfeet)\n\n\nanswer200\n\n\ncode example 2\n\np <- 3.14 - 0.14\nr <- 5\n\nprint(p * r^2)\n\n\nanswer75\n\n\ncode example 3\n\ntax <- 17.5\nprice <- 4.50\nsales <- 128\ntax <- 20\n\nincome <- (sales * price) * (1 + (tax/100))\n\n\nanswer# prints nothing! there isn't a print statement\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Naming objects\nCorrectly naming objects is very important. You can give an object almost any name, but there are a few rules to follow:\n\nName them something sensible\nR is case sensitive, myName is not equal to (!=) myname\n\nDon’t use spaces in names\nDon’t start a name with a number\nKeep punctuation in object names to underscore (_ and full stop .) e.g. my_name, my.name.\nStick to a convention for all your objects, it’ll make your code easier to read, e.g.\n\n\nmyName, yourName, ourName (this is camelCase 2)\n\nmy_name, your_name, our_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe actual name of an object has no effect on what it does (other than invalid names breaking your program!). For example age <- \"Barry\" is perfectly valid to R, it’s just a real pain for a human to read.\n\n\n\n2.4.2.1 Questions\n\nWhich of these are valid R object names:\n\nmy_Number\nmy-Number\nmyNumber!\nfirst name\nFIRSTname\ni\n3names\nnames3\n\n\nanswers# my_Number  (VALID)\n# my-Number  (VALID)\n# myNumber!  (INVALID due to !)\n# first name (INVALID due to space)\n# FIRSTname  (VALID but don't recommend so many caps)\n# i          (VALID)\n# 3names     (INVALID starts with a 3)\n# names3     (VALID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more information on the R programming style guide, see this\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Comments\nCode can often look confusing and it’s a good idea to add # comments to your code to make it more understandable for you and others. The computer ignores comments when running your code:\n\n# this calculates the average sales per shop\n\nincome1 <- 132\nincome2 <- 665\nincome3 <- 233\nincome4 <- 1200\n\nshops <- 4 # everything after the hash is a comment\n\navgSales <- sum(income1, income2, income3, income4) / shops  \n\n# sometimes you might want to comment out code that\n# is no longer needed, but might be useful later\n# standard_deviation <- sd(c(income1, income2, income3, income4) )\n# the above code isn't run\n\nprint(avgSales) # but this code is\n\n[1] 557.5"

    "section": "\n2.5 Datatypes",
    "text": "2.5 Datatypes\nWe have already met two different datatypes, the character datatype for words and letters (e.g. \"Peter\") and the numeric datatype for numbers (e.g. 12). Datatypes tell R how to handle data in certain circumstances. Sometimes data will be of the wrong datatype and you will need to convert between datatypes.\n\nweeks <- 4\ndays_in_week <- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\n# but it doesn't work!\ntotal_days <- weeks * days_in_week \n\nError in weeks * days_in_week: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nWhilst R will understand what to do when we multiply numbers with numbers, it gets very confused and raises an error when we try to perform an arithmetic operation using words and numbers.\nTo perform the calculation we will need to convert the days_in_week from a string to a number, using the as.numeric(<text>) command:\n\nweeks <- 4\ndays_in_week <- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\ntotal_days <- weeks * as.numeric(days_in_week)\n\nThere is a logical datatype for boolean values of TRUE and FALSE. This will become a lot more useful later.\n\nlegs_snake <- TRUE # you can specify logical values directly\ndogs_legs <- 4\nlegs_dog <- dogs_legs > 0 # or as part of a calculation\n\n# Do dog's have legs?\nprint(legs_dog)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThere are actually three datatypes for numbers in R, numeric for most of your work, the rarer integer specifically for whole numbers and the even rarer complex for complex numbers. When you are looking at categorical data, factors are used on top of the underlying datatype to store the different values, for example you might have a field of character to store countries, factors would then list the different countries stored in this character field.\nTo change from one datatype to another we use the as.____ command: as.numeric(<text>), as.logical(<data>), as.character(<numeric>).\n\n2.5.0.1 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix them so it outputs: “July is month 7”?\n\n\nmonth <- \"July\"\norder <- 7\n  \nprint(month)\nPrint(\"is\")\nprint(month)\nprint(\"order\")\n\n\nanswermonth <- \"July\"\norder <- 7\n  \nprint(month)    \nprint(\"is\")     #1 print needs a lowercase p\nprint(\"month\")  #2 month is a character not an object, use speech marks\nprint(order)    #3 order is an object, not a character, so drop the speech marks\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\na <- 7\nb <- \"8\"\nc < - 3\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\nanswera <- 7\nb <- 8 #1 b is numeric so drop the speech marks\nc <- 3 #2 the arrow needs to be together, remove the space\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\npass mark <- 50 \nexam_grade <- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade > pass_mark)\n\n\nanswerpass_mark <- 50 #1 the variable name can't have any spaces\nexam_grade <- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade >= pass_mark) # this needs to be >= as they had a passing grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to find out the datatype of an object you can use the structure str command to give you more information about the object. In this instance chr means that month is of character datatype and num means it is of the numeric datatype.\n\nmonth <- \"July\"\nstr(month)\n\n chr \"July\"\n\nmonth <- 7\nstr(month)\n\n num 7\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Vectors\nSo far we have seen how R does simple calculations and prints out the results. Underlying all of this are vectors. Vectors are data structures that bring together one or data elements of the same datatype. E.g. we might have a numeric vector recording the grades of a class, or a character vector storing the gender of a set of students. To define a vector we use c(<item>, <item>, ...), where c stands for combine. Vectors are very important to R3, even declaring a single object, x <- 6, is creating a vector of size one. Larger vectors look like this:\n\nmaths_grade <-   c(5,    4,    4,    1,     7,     5,     8)\nenglish_grade <- c(8,    5,    3,    2,     3,     6,     9)\ngenders <-      c(\"F\",  \"M\",  \"M\",  \"F\",   \"M\",   \"F\",   \"M\")\nstudents <-     c(\"Joe\", \"Al\", \"Mo\", \"Flo\", \"Olu\", \"Sam\", \"Jimmy\")\n\nYou can quickly perform calculations across whole vectors:\n\n# convert all genders to the lower case form\ntolower(genders) \n\n[1] \"f\" \"m\" \"m\" \"f\" \"m\" \"f\" \"m\"\n\n# raise everyone's maths grade by one(!?)\nmaths_grade + 1\n\n[1] 6 5 5 2 8 6 9\n\n\nWe can also perform calculations across vectors, in the example below we can find out which students got a better grade in Maths than in English.\n\n# this compares each pair of values\n# e.g. the first item in maths_grade (5) with\n# the first item in english_grade (8)\n# and so on\n# This returns a logical vector of TRUE and FALSE\nmaths_grade > english_grade\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n# To work out how many students got a better grade \n# in maths than in English we can apply sum()\n# to the logical vector. \n# We know that TRUE == 1, FALSE == 0,\n# so sum() will count all the TRUEs\nsum(maths_grade > english_grade)\n\n[1] 2\n\n# if you want to find out the average grade for\n# each student in maths and english\n# add both vectors together and divide by 2\n(maths_grade + english_grade) / 2\n\n[1] 6.5 4.5 3.5 1.5 5.0 5.5 8.5\n\n# we can use square brackets to pick a value from a vector\n# vectors start couting from 1, so students[1] would pick Jo\nstudents[1]\n\n[1] \"Joe\"\n\n# we can pass a numeric vector to a another vector to create a\n# subset, in the example below we find the 3rd and 5th item\n\nstudents[c(3,5)]\n\n[1] \"Mo\"  \"Olu\"\n\n# we can also use a vector of TRUE and FALSE to pick items\n# TRUE will pick an item, FALSE will ignore it\n# for each maths_grade > english_grade that is TRUE\n# the name in that position in the student vector will be shown\nstudents[maths_grade > english_grade]\n\n[1] \"Mo\"  \"Olu\"\n\n\nYou should be careful when trying to compare vectors of different lengths. When combining vectors of different lengths, the shorter vector will match the length of the longer vector by wrapping its values around. For example if we try to combine a vector of the numbers 1 ot 10 with a two item logical vector TRUE FALSE, the logical vector will repeat 5 times: c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE). We can use this vector as a mask to return the odd numbers, TRUE means keep, FALSE means ignore:\n\nnums <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)\nmask <- c(TRUE, FALSE) \n\n# you can see the repeat of mask by pasting them together\npaste(nums, mask)\n\n [1] \"1 TRUE\"   \"2 FALSE\"  \"3 TRUE\"   \"4 FALSE\"  \"5 TRUE\"   \"6 FALSE\" \n [7] \"7 TRUE\"   \"8 FALSE\"  \"9 TRUE\"   \"10 FALSE\"\n\n# now to filter out the numbers we don't want\nnums[mask]\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 9\n\n\nThis might not seem very useful, but it comes in very handy when we want to perform a single calculation across a whole vector. For example, we want to find all the students who achieved grade 5 in English, the below code creates a vector of 5s the same size as english_grade:\n\n# this can also be rewritten english_grade >= c(5)\n# note, when we are doing a comparison, we need to use double ==\nstudents[english_grade == 5]\n\n[1] \"Al\"\n\n#which is the same as\nstudents[english_grade == c(5,5,5,5,5,5,5)]\n\n[1] \"Al\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen we are doing a comparison, we need to use double == equals sign. Using a single equals sign is the equivalent of an assignment = is the same as <-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are several shortcuts that you can take when creating vectors. Instead of writing a whole sequence of numbers by hand, you can use the seq(<start>, <finish>, <step>) command. For example:\n\n# the step default is 1, so you can miss it from seq(1,10,1)\nseq(1,10)   == c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)\nseq(1,10,2) == c(1,3,5,7,9)\n\nThis allows for some pretty short ways of solving quite complex problems, for example if you wanted to know the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000, you could write it like this:\n\n# the unique() command gives you the unique items in a vector\nsum(unique(c(seq(3, 999, 3), seq(5, 999, 5))))\n\nAnother shortcut is writing T, F, or 1, 0 instead of the whole words TRUE, FALSE:\n\nc(T, F) == c(1, 0) == c(TRUE, FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the four problems with this code:\n\n\nnums <- v(1,2,\"3\",4,7,2,2)\nsum(nums)\nmean(nums)\n# return a vector of all numbers greater than 2\nnums(nums >= 2)\n\n\nanswernums <- c(1,2,3,4,7,2,2) \n#1 a vector is declared using c(), not v()\n#2 3 should be numeric, so no need for speech marks\n# (though technically R would do this conversion for you!)\n\nsum(nums)\nmean(nums)\n# return a vector of all numbers greater than 2\nnums[nums >= 2] #3 to pick items from another vector, use square brackets\n\n\n\nCreate a vector to store the number of glasses of water you have drunk for each day in the last 7 days.

    "text": "2.6 Packages and libraries\nR comes with some excellent statistical tools, but often you will need to supplement them with packages4 . Packages contain functionality that isn’t built into R by default, but you can choose to load or install them to meet the needs of your tasks. For example you have code packages to deal with SPSS data, and other packages to run machine learning algorithms. Nearly all R packages are free to use!\n\n2.6.1 Installing and loading packages\nTo install a package you can use the package tab in the bottom right-hand panel of RStudio and follow the steps from Section 2.2.2. Alternatively you can install things by typing:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nNote that the instruction is to install packages, you can pass a vector of package names to install multiple packages at the same time:\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\",\"readxl\",\"haven\"))\n\nOnce a package is installed it doesn’t mean that you can use it, yet. You will need to load the package. To do this you need to use the library(<package_name>) command, for example:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSome packages might use the same function names as other packages, for example select might do different things depending on which package you loaded last. As a rule of thumb, when you start RStudio afresh, make sure that you load the tidyverse package after you have loaded all your other packages. To read more about this problem see Section 9.1"

    "text": "2.7 The tidyverse\nThis course focuses on using the tidyverse; a free collection of programming packages that will allow you to write code that imports data, tidys it, transforms it into useful datasets, visualises findings, creates statistical models and communicates findings to others data using a standardised set of commands.\n\n\nData science workflow - RStudio\n\n\nFor many people the tidyverse is the main reason that they use R. The tidyverse is used widely in government, academia, NGOs and industry, notable examples include the Financial Times and the BBC. Code in the tidyverse can be (relatively) easily understood by others and you, when you come back to a project after several months.\n\n\n\n\n# load the tidyverse packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# download Covid data from website\ndeaths <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/excess_mortality/excess_mortality.csv\")\n\ndeaths <- deaths %>% \n     filter(location %in% \n              c(\"United States\", \"United Kingdom\", \n                \"Sweden\", \"Germany\")) %>%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))\n\nggplot(data=deaths) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, \n                y = excess_per_million_proj_all_ages, \n                colour=location)) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTry this out\nThe code above transforms data and converts it into a graph.

    "section": "\n2.8 Loading data",
    "text": "2.8 Loading data\nWe can’t do much with R without loading data from elsewhere. Data will come in many formats and R should be able to deal with all of them. Some of the datasets you access will be a few rows and columns; others, like the ones we are going to use on this course, might run into hundreds of thousands or even millions of rows and hundreds or thousands of columns. Depending on the format you are using, you might need to use specific packages. A few of the data file types you might meet are described below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile type\nDescription\n\n\n\nComma separated values [.csv]\nAs it says in the name, .csv files store data by separating data items with commas. They are a common way of transferring data and can be easily created and read by Excel, Google spreadsheets and text editors (in addition to R). CSVs aren’t compressed so will generally be larger than other file types. They don’t store information on the types of data stored in the file so you might find yourself having to specify that a date column is a date, rather than a string of text. You can read and write csv files without the need to load any packages, but if you do use readr you might find things go much faster.\n\n\nExcel [.xls | .xlsx | .xlsxm]\nExcel files store data in a compressed custom format. This means files will generally be smaller than CSVs and will also contain information on the types of data stored in different columns. R can read and write these files using the openxlsx package, but you can also use the tidyverse’s readxl for reading, and writexl for writing for excel formats.\n\n\nR Data [.rds]\nR has it’s own data format, .rds. Saving to this format means that you will make perfect copies of your R data, including data types and factors. When you load .rds files they will look exactly the same as when you saved them. Data can be highly compressed and it’s one of the fastest formats for getting data into R. You can read and write .rds files without the need to load any packages, but using the functions in readr might speed things up a bit. You won’t be able to look at .rds files in other programs such as Excel\n\n\nArrow [.parquet]\nApache Arrow .parquet is a relatively new format that allows for the transfer of files between different systems. Files are small and incredibly fast to load, whilst looking exactly the same as when you save them. The PISA dataset used here, that takes ~20 seconds to load in .rds format, will load in less than 2 seconds in .parquet format. Because of the way that data is stored you won’t be able to open these files in programs such as Excel. You will need the arrow package to read and write .parquet files.\n\n\nSPSS [.sav]\nSPSS is a common analysis tool in the world of social science. The native format for SPSS data is .sav. These files are compressed and include information on column labels and column datatypes. You will need either the haven or foreign packages to read data into R. Once you have loaded the .sav you will probably want to convert the data into a format that is more suitable for R, normally this will involve converting columns into factors. We cover factors in more detail below.\n\n\nStata [.dta]\n\nhaven or foreign packages to read data into R\n\n\nSAS [.sas]\n\nhaven or foreign packages to read data into R\n\n\nStructured Query Language [.sql]\na common format for data stored in large databases. Normally SQL code would be used to query these, you can use the tidyverse to help construct SQL this through the package dbplyr which will convert your tidyverse pipe code into SQL. R can be set up to communicate directly with databases using the DBI package.\n\n\nJavaScript Object Notation [.json]\n\n.json is a popular format for sharing data on the web. You can use jsonlite and rjson to access this type of data\n\n\n\nFor this course we will be looking at .csv, excel, .rds and parquet files.\n\n2.8.1 Dataframes\nLoading datasets into R will normally store them as dataframes (also known as tibbles when using the tidyverse). Dataframes are the equivalent of tables in a spreadsheet, with rows, columns and datatypes.\n\n\n\nThe table above has 4 columns, each column has a datatype, CNT is a character vector, PV1MATH is a double (numeric) vector, ESCS is a double (numeric) vector and ST211Q01HA is a factor. For more about datatypes, see Section 2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCore to the tidyverse is the idea of tidy data, a rule of thumb for creating datasets that can be easily manipulated, modeled and presented. Tidy data are datasets where each variable is a column and each observation a row.\nThis data isn’t tidy data as each row has contains multiple exam results (observations):\n\n\nID\nExam 1\nGrade 1\nExam 2\nGrade 2\n\n\n\nR2341\nEnglish\n4\nMaths\n5\n\n\nR8842\nEnglish\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataframe is tidy data as each student has one entry for each exam:\n\n\nID\nExam\nGrade\n\n\n\nR2341\nEnglish\n4\n\n\nR2341\nMaths\n5\n\n\nR8842\nEnglish\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we need to get some data into R so we can start analysing them. We can load large datatables into R by either providing the online web address, or by loading it from a local file directory on your hard drive. Both methods are covered below:\n\n2.8.2 Loading data from the web\nTo download files from the web you’ll need to find the exact location of the file you are using. For example below we will need another package, openxlsx, which you need to install before you load it (see: Section 2.2.2, or use line 1 below). The code shown will download the files from an online Google drive directly into objects in R using read.xlsx(<file_web_address>, <sheet_name>):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo convert data on your google drive into a link that works in R, you can use the following website: https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/. Note that not all read/load commands in R will work with web addresses and some will require you have to copies of the datasets on your disk drive. Additionally, downloading large datasets from the web directly into R can be very slow, loading the dataset from your harddrive will nearly always be much faster.\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"openxlsx\")\nlibrary(openxlsx)\n\nresults <- read.xlsx(\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1tp9xe3dS__eg7RrXf0T_oMxcrz_TbMdM\",\n                      sheet=\"Results\")\nschools <- read.xlsx(\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1tp9xe3dS__eg7RrXf0T_oMxcrz_TbMdM\",\n                      sheet=\"Schools\")\n\n\n2.8.3 Loading data from your computer\nDownloading files directly from web addresses can be slow and you might want to prefer to use files saved to your computer’s hard drive. You can do this by following the steps below:\nDownload the PISA_2018_student_subset.parquet file from here and save it to your computer where your R code file is.\nCopy the location of the file (see next step for help)\n\n\nTo find the location of a file in Windows do the following:\n\n\nNavigate to the location of the file in Windows Explorer:\n\n\n\nClick on the address bar\n\n\nCopy the location\n\n\n\nTo find the location of a file in Mac OSX do the following:\n\nOpen Finder\nNavigate to the folder where you saved the file\n\nRight click on the name of the file, then press the option ⌥ (or Alt) button and select Copy <name of file> as Pathname\n\n\nAlternatively, follow this\n\n\n\nTo load this particular data into R we need to use the read_parquet command from the arrow package, specifying the location and name of the file we are loading. See the following code:\n\ninstall.packages(\"arrow\")\nlibrary(arrow)\n\nPISA_2018 <- read_parquet(r\"[C:/Users/Peter/code/PISA_2018_student_subset.parquet]\")\n\n\n2.8.4 Setting working directories\nUsing the setwd(<location>) you can specify where R will look by default for any datasets. In the example below, the dfe_data.xlsx will have been downloaded and stored in C:/Users/Peter/code. By running setwd(\"C:/Users/Peter/code\") R will always look in that location when trying to load files, meaning that read_parquet(r\"[C:/Users/Peter/code/PISA_2018_student_subset.parquet]\") will be treated the same as read_parquet(r\"[PISA_2018_student_subset.parquet]\")\n\n# context: setup\nsetwd(r\"[C:/Users/Peter/code/]\")\nPISA_2018 <- read_parquet(r\"[PISA_2018_student_subset.parquet]\")\n\nTo work out what your current working directory is, you can use getwd().\n\n2.8.5 Proper addresses\nYou might have found that you get an error if you don’t convert your backslashes \\ into forwardslashes /. It’s common mistake and very annoying. In most programming languages a backslash signifies the start of a special command, for example \\n signifies a newline.\nWith R there are three ways to get around the problem of backslashes in file locations, for the location:\"C:\\myfolder\\\" we could:\n\nreplace them with forwardslashes (as shown above):\"C:/myfolder/\"\n\nreplace them with double backslashes (the special character specified by two backslashes is one backslash!):\"C:\\\\myfolder\\\\\"\n\nuse the inbuilt R command to deal with filenames: r\"[C:\\myfolder\\]\"\n\n\n2.8.6 .parquet files\nFor the majority of this workbook you will be using a cutdown version of the PISA_2018 student table. This dataset is huge and we have loaded it into R, selected fields we think are useful, converted column types to work with R and saved in the .parquet format. .parquet files are quick to load and small in size. To load an .parquet file you can use the read_parquet(<location>) command from the arrow package.\n\nlibrary(arrow)\nPISA_2018 <- read_parquet(\"<yourfolder>/PISA_2018_student_subset.parquet\")\n\nIf you want to save out any of your findings, you can use write_parquet(<object>, <location>), where object is the table you are working on and location is where you want to save it.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nwrite_rds(PISA_2018 %>% filter(CNT==\"France\"),\n                      \"<yourfolder>/pisa_france_2018.parquet\")\n\n\n2.8.7 .csv files\nA very common way of distributing data is through .csv files. These files can be easily compressed and opened in common office spreadsheet tools such as Excel. To load a .csv we can use read_csv(\"<file_location>\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# loading from a website\ndata <- read_csv(\"https://barrolee.github.io/BarroLeeDataSet/BLData/BL_v3_MF.csv\")\n\n# loading from your hard drive\ndata <- read_csv(\"<your_folder>/BL_v3_MF.csv\")\n\nYou might want to save your own work as a .csv for use later or for manipulation in another tool e.g. Excel. To do this we can use write_csv(<your_data>, \"<your_folder><name>.csv\"). NOTE: don’t forget to add .csv to the end of your “.csv”, otherwise you might struggle to open the file in another program.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# loading from a website\nwrite_csv(data, \"summary_stats.csv\")"

This is data for all the students from around the world that took part in PISA 2018. The actual PISA dataset has many more columns than this, but for the examples here we have selected 205 of the more interesting data variables. The column names might seem rather confusing and you might want to refer to the PISA 2018 code book to find out what everything means.\nThe data shown in the console window is only the top few rows and first few columns. To see the whole table click on the Environment panel and the table icon  to explore the table:\n\nAlternatively, you can also hold down command ⌘|control and click on the table name in your R Script to view the table. You can also type View(<table_name>). Note: this has a capital “V”\nIn the table view mode you can read the label attached to each column, this will give you more detail about what the column stores. If you hover over columns it will display the label:\n\nAlternatively, to read the full label of a column, the following code can be used:\n\n# You might also want to read the label of a field\nattr(PISA_2018$ST013Q01TA, \"label\")\n\n[1] \"How many books are there in your home?\"\n\n\nEach view only shows you 50 columns, to see more use the navigation panel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo learn more about loading data from in other formats, e.g. SPSS and STATA, look at the tidyverse documentation for haven.\n\n\nThe PISA_2018 dataframe is made up of multiple columns, with each column acting like a vector, which means each column stores values of only one datatype. If we look at the first four columns of the schools table, you can see the CNTSTUID, ESCS and PV1MATH columns are <dbl> (numeric) and the other three columns are of <fctr> (factor), a special datatype in R that helps store categorical and ordinal variables, see Section 2.11.2 for more information on how factors work.\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  CNTSTUID ST004D01T CNT       ESCS PV1MATH\n     <dbl> <fct>     <fct>    <dbl>   <dbl>\n1   800251 Male      Albania  0.675    490.\n2   800402 Male      Albania -0.757    462.\n3   801902 Female    Albania -2.51     407.\n4   803546 Male      Albania -3.18     483.\n5   804776 Male      Albania -1.76     460.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVectors are data structures that bring together one or more data elements of the same datatype. E.g. we might have a numeric vector recording the grades of a class, or a character vector storing the gender of a set of students. To define a vector we use c(item, item, ...), where c stands for combine. Vectors are very important to R, even declaring a single object, x <- 6, is creating a vector of size one. To find out more about vectors see: Section 2.5.1\n\n\nWe can find out some general information about the table we have loaded. nrow and ncol tell you about the dimensions of the table\n\nnrow(PISA_2018)  # how many rows are in the results table\n\n[1] 612004\n\nncol(PISA_2018)  # how many columns are in the results table\n\n[1] 205\n\n\nIf we want to know the names of the columns we can use the names() command that returns a vector. This can be a little confusing as it’ll return the names used in the dataframe, which can be hard to interpret, e.g. ST004D01T is PISA’s way of encoding gender.

    "text": "2.10 Piping and dplyr\nPiping allows us to break down complex tasks into manageable chunks that can be written and tested one after another. There are several powerful commands in the tidyverse as part of the dplyr package that can help us group, filter, select, mutate and summarise datasets. With this small set of commands we can use piping to convert massive datasets into simple and useful results.\nUsing the pipe %>% command, we can feed the results from one command into the next command making for reusable and easy to read code.\n\n\nhow piping works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe pipe command we are using %>% is from the magrittr package which is installed alongside the tidyverse. Recently R introduced another pipe |> which offers very similar functionality and tutorials online might use either. The examples below use the %>% pipe.\n\n\nLet’s look at an example of using the pipe on the PISA_2018 table to calculate the best performing OECD countries for maths PV1MATH by gender ST004D01T:\n\nPISA_2018 %>% \n  filter(OECD == \"Yes\") %>%\n  group_by(CNT, ST004D01T) %>% \n  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd_maths = sd(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            students = n()) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_maths))\n\n# A tibble: 74 × 5\n# Groups:   CNT [37]\n   CNT            ST004D01T mean_maths sd_maths students\n   <fct>          <fct>          <dbl>    <dbl>    <int>\n 1 Japan          Male            533.     90.5     2989\n 2 Korea          Male            530.    102.      3459\n 3 Estonia        Male            528.     85.0     2665\n 4 Japan          Female          523.     82.2     3120\n 5 Korea          Female          523.     96.0     3191\n 6 Switzerland    Male            520.     92.7     3033\n 7 Estonia        Female          519.     76.0     2651\n 8 Czech Republic Male            518.     98.0     3501\n 9 Belgium        Male            518.     95.9     4204\n10 Poland         Male            517.     91.8     2768\n# … with 64 more rows\n\n\n\nline 1 passes the whole PISA_2018 dataset and pipes it into the next line %>%\n\nline 2 filters out any results that are from non-OECD countries by finding all the rows where OECD equals == “Yes”, this is then piped to the next line\nline 3 groups the data by country CNT and by student gender ST004D01T, this is then piped to the next line\nline 4-6 the summarise command performs a calculation on the country and gender groupings returning three new columns, each command on a new line and separated by a comma: the mean value for maths mean_maths, the standard deviation sd_maths and a column telling us how many students were in each grouping using the n() which returns the number of rows in a group. These new columns and the grouping columns are then piped to the next line\nline 7 filters out any gender ST004D01T that is NA. First is finds all the students that have NA as their gender by using is.na(ST004D01T), then is NOTs/flips the result using the exclamation mark !, giving those students who don’t have their gender set to NA. The filtered data is then piped to the next line\nline 8, finally we arrange / sort the results in descending order by the mean_maths column. The default for arrange is ascending order, leave out the desc(  ) for the numbers to be ordered in the opposite way.\n\nMales get a slightly better maths score than Females for this PV1MATH score, other scores are available, please read Section 8.1.4.1 to find out more about the limitations of using this value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nwe met the assignment command earlier <-. Within the tidyverse commands we use the equals sign instead =.\n\n\nThe commands we have just used come from a package within the tidyverse called dplyr, let’s take a look at what they do:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommand\npurpose\nexample\n\n\n\nselect\nreduce the dataframe to the fields that you specify\nselect(<field>, <field>, <field>)\n\n\nfilter\nget rid of rows that don’t meet one or more criteria\nfilter(<field> <comparison>)\n\n\ngroup\ngroup fields together to perform calculations\ngroup_by(<field>, <field>))\n\n\nmutate\nadd new fields or change values in current fields\nmutate(<new_field> = <field> / 2)\n\n\nsummarise\ncreate summary data optionally using a grouping command\nsummarise(<new_field> = max(<field>))\n\n\narrange\norder the results by one or more fields\narrange(desc(<field>))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to explore more of the functions of dplyr, take a look at the helpsheet\n\n\n\nAdjust the code above to find out the lowest performing countries for reading PV1READ by gender that are not in the OECD\n\nanswerPISA_2018 %>% \n  filter(OECD == \"No\") %>%\n  group_by(CNT, ST004D01T) %>% \n  summarise(mean_read = mean(PV1READ, na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd_read = sd(PV1READ, na.rm=TRUE),\n            students = n()) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T)) %>%\n  arrange(mean_read)\n\n\n\n\n2.10.1 select\nThe PISA_2018 dataset has far too many fields, to reduce the number of fields to focus on just a few of them we can use select\n\nPISA_2018 %>% select(CNT,ESCS, ST004D01T, ST003D02T)\n\n# A tibble: 612,004 × 4\n   CNT       ESCS ST004D01T ST003D02T\n   <fct>    <dbl> <fct>     <fct>    \n 1 Albania  0.675 Male      February \n 2 Albania -0.757 Male      July     \n 3 Albania -2.51  Female    April    \n 4 Albania -3.18  Male      April    \n 5 Albania -1.76  Male      March    \n 6 Albania -1.49  Female    February \n 7 Albania NA     Female    July     \n 8 Albania -3.25  Male      August   \n 9 Albania -1.72  Female    March    \n10 Albania NA     Female    July     \n# … with 611,994 more rows\n\n\nYou might also be in the situation where you want to select everything but one or two fields, you can do this with the negative signal -:\n\nPISA_2018 %>% select(-CNT, -OECD)\n\n# A tibble: 612,004 × 203\n   ISCEDL ISCEDD ISCEDO PROGN WVARS…¹ COBN_F COBN_M COBN_S GRADE SUBNA…² STRATUM\n   <fct>  <fct>  <fct>  <fct>   <dbl> <fct>  <fct>  <fct>  <fct> <fct>   <fct>  \n 1 ISCED… C      Vocat… Alba…       3 Alban… Alban… Alban… 0     Albania ALB -

To rename columns in the tidyverse we use the rename(<new_name> = <old_name>) command. For example, if you wanted to rename the rather confusing student column for gender, also known as ST004D01T, and the column for having a dictionary at home, also known as ST011Q12TA, you could use:\n\nPISA_2018 %>%\n  rename(gender = ST004D01T,\n         dictionary = ST011Q12TA) %>%\n  select(CNT, gender, dictionary) %>% \n  summary()\n\n                   CNT                    gender                dictionary    \n Spain               : 35943   Female        :304958   Yes           :524311  \n Canada              : 22653   Male          :307044   No            : 66730  \n Kazakhstan          : 19507   Valid Skip    :     0   Valid Skip    :     0  \n United Arab Emirates: 19277   Not Applicable:     0   Not Applicable:     0  \n Australia           : 14273   Invalid       :     0   Invalid       :     0  \n Qatar               : 13828   No Response   :     0   No Response   :     0  \n (Other)             :486523   NA's          :     2   NA's          : 20963  \n\n\nIf you want to change the name of the column so that it stays when you need to perform another calculation, remember to assign the renamed dataframe back to the original dataframe. But be warned, you’ll need to reload the full dataset to restore the original names:\n\nPISA_2018 <- PISA_2018 %>%\n    rename(gender = ST004D01T,\n           dictionary = ST011Q12TA)\n\n\n2.10.4 group_by and summarise\nSo far we have looked at ways to return rows that meet certain criteria. Using group_by and summarise we can start to analyse data for different groups of students. For example, let’s look at the number of students who don’t have internet connections at home ST011Q06TA:\n\nPISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(ST011Q06TA) %>%\n  summarise(student_n = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  ST011Q06TA student_n\n  <fct>          <int>\n1 Yes           543010\n2 No             49703\n3 <NA>           19291\n\n\n\nLine 1 passes the full PISA_2018 to the pipe\nLine 2 makes groups within PISA_2018 using the unique values of ST011Q06TA\n\nLine 3, these groups are then passed to summarise, which creates a new column called student_n and stores the number of rows in each ST011Q06TA group using the n() command. summarise only returns the columns it creates, or are in the group_by, everything else is discarded.\n\nWhat we might want to do is look at this data from a country by country perspective, by adding another field to the group_by() command, we then group by the unique combination of countries CNT and internet access ST011Q06TA, e.g. Albania+Yes; Albania+No; Albania+NA; Brazil+Yes; etc\n\nint_by_cnt <- PISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(CNT, ST011Q06TA) %>%\n  summarise(student_n = n())\n\nprint(int_by_cnt)\n\n# A tibble: 240 × 3\n# Groups:   CNT [80]\n   CNT                  ST011Q06TA student_n\n   <fct>                <fct>          <int>\n 1 Albania              Yes             5059\n 2 Albania              No              1084\n 3 Albania              <NA>             216\n 4 United Arab Emirates Yes            17616\n 5 United Arab Emirates No               949\n 6 United Arab Emirates <NA>             712\n 7 Argentina            Yes             9871\n 8 Argentina            No              1781\n 9 Argentina            <NA>             323\n10 Australia            Yes            12547\n# … with 230 more rows\n\n\nsummarise can also be used to work out statistics by grouping. For example, if you wanted to find out the max, mean and min science grade PV1SCIE by country CNT, you could do the following:\n\nPISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(CNT) %>%\n  summarise(sci_max  = max(PV1SCIE,  na.rm = TRUE),\n            sci_mean = mean(PV1SCIE, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sci_min  = min(PV1SCIE,  na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 4\n   CNT                    sci_max sci_mean sci_min\n   <fct>                    <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 Albania                   674.     417.   166. \n 2 United Arab Emirates      778.     425.    86.3\n 3 Argentina                 790.     418.   138. \n 4 Australia                 879.     502.   153. \n 5 Austria                   779.     493.   175. \n 6 Belgium                   764.     502.   196. \n 7 Bulgaria                  741.     426.   145. \n 8 Bosnia and Herzegovina    664.     398.   152. \n 9 Belarus                   799.     474.   192. \n10 Brazil                    747.     407.    95.6\n# … with 70 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\ngroup_by() can have unintended consequences in your code if you are saving your pipes to new dataframes. To be safe your can clear any grouping by adding: my_data %>% ungroup()\n\n\n\n2.10.4.1 Questions\n\n\nSpot the three errors with the following summarise statement\n\n\nPISA_2018 %>% \n  group(CNT)\n  summarise(num_stus = n)\n\n\nanswerPISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(CNT) %>% #1 group_by NOT group #2 missing pipe %>%\n  summarise(num_stus = n()) #3 = n() not = n\n\n\n\nWrite a group_by and summarise statement to work out the mean and median cultural capital value ESCS for each student by country CNT\n\n\n\nanswerPISA_2018 %>%\n  group_by(CNT) %>%\n  summarise(escs_mean = mean(ESCS, na.rm=TRUE),\n            escs_median = median(ESCS, na.rm=TRUE))\n\n\n\nUsing summarise work out, Yes or No, by country CNT and gender ST004D01T, whether students “reduce the energy I use at home […] to protect the environment.” ST222Q01HA.

To do this we can use mutate. Unlike summarise, mutate retains all the other columns either adding a new column or changing an existing one\n\nmutate(<field> = <field_calculation>)\n\nThe PISA_2018 dataset has results for maths PV1MATH, science PV1SCIE and reading PV1READ. We could combine these to create an overall PISA_grade, and PISA_mean:\n\nPISA_2018 %>%\n  mutate(PV1_total = PV1MATH + PV1SCIE + PV1READ,\n         PV1_mean = PV1_total/3) %>%\n  select(CNT, ESCS, PV1_total, PV1_mean)\n\n# A tibble: 612,004 × 4\n   CNT       ESCS PV1_total PV1_mean\n   <fct>    <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n 1 Albania  0.675     1311.     437.\n 2 Albania -0.757     1319.     440.\n 3 Albania -2.51      1158.     386.\n 4 Albania -3.18      1424.     475.\n 5 Albania -1.76      1094.     365.\n 6 Albania -1.49      1004.     335.\n 7 Albania NA         1311.     437.\n 8 Albania -3.25      1104.     368.\n 9 Albania -1.72      1268.     423.\n10 Albania NA         1213.     404.\n# … with 611,994 more rows\n\n\n\nline 2 mutate creates a new field called PV1_total made up by adding together the columns for maths, science and reading. Each column acts like a vector and adding them together is the equivalent of adding each students individual grades together, row by row. See Section 2.5.1 for more details on vector addition.\nline 3 inside the same mutate statement, we take the PV1_total calculated on line 2 and divide it by 3, to give us a mean value, this is then assigned to a new column, PV1_mean.\nline 4 this line selects only the fields that we are interested in, dropping the others\n\nWe can use mutate to create subsets of data in fields. For example, if we wanted to see how many students in each country were high performing readers, specified by getting a reading grade of greater than 550, we could do the following:\n\nPISA_2018 %>%\n  mutate(PV1READ_high = PV1READ > 550) %>%\n  group_by(CNT, PV1READ_high) %>%\n  summarise(n = n())\n\n# A tibble: 159 × 3\n# Groups:   CNT [80]\n   CNT                  PV1READ_high     n\n   <fct>                <lgl>        <int>\n 1 Albania              FALSE         6083\n 2 Albania              TRUE           276\n 3 United Arab Emirates FALSE        16567\n 4 United Arab Emirates TRUE          2710\n 5 Argentina            FALSE        11003\n 6 Argentina            TRUE           972\n 7 Australia            FALSE         9311\n 8 Australia            TRUE          4962\n 9 Austria              FALSE         4900\n10 Austria              TRUE          1902\n# … with 149 more rows\n\n\nComparisons can also be made between different columns, if we wanted to find out the percentage of Males and Females that got a better grade in their maths test PV1MATH than in their reading test PV1READ:\n\nPISA_2018 %>%\n  mutate(maths_better = PV1MATH > PV1READ) %>%\n  select(CNT, ST004D01T, maths_better, PV1MATH, PV1READ) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T), !is.na(maths_better)) %>%\n  group_by(ST004D01T) %>%\n  mutate(students_n = n()) %>%\n  group_by(ST004D01T, maths_better) %>%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            per = n/unique(students_n))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n# Groups:   ST004D01T [2]\n  ST004D01T maths_better      n   per\n  <fct>     <lgl>         <int> <dbl>\n1 Female    FALSE        176021 0.583\n2 Female    TRUE         126157 0.417\n3 Male      FALSE        110269 0.362\n4 Male      TRUE         194178 0.638\n\n\n\nline 2 mutate creates a new field called maths_better made up by comparing the PV1MATH grade with PV1READ and creating a boolean/logical vector for the column.\nline 3 selects a subset of the columns\nline 4 filters out any students that don’t have gender data ST004D01T, or where the calculation on line 2 failed, i.e. PV1MATH or PV1READ was NA\n\nline 5 group on the gender of the student\nline 6 using the group on line 5, use mutate to calculate the total number of Males and Females by looking for the number of rows in each group n(), store this as students_n\n\nline 7 re-group the data on gender ST004D01T and whether the student is better at maths than reading maths_better\n\nline 8 count the number of students, n in each group, as specified by line 7.\nline 9 create a percentage figure for the number of students in each grouping given by line 7. Use the n value from line 8 and the students_n value from line 6. NOTE: we need to use unique(students_n) to return just one value for each grouping rather than a value for every row of the line 7 grouping\n\nFor more information on how to mutate fields using ifelse, see Section 2.11.1\n\n2.10.6 arrange\nThe results returned by pipes can be huge, so it’s a good idea to store them in objects and explore them in the Environment window where you can sort and search within the output. There might also be times when you want to order/arrange the outputs in a particular way. We can do this quite easily in the tidyverse by using the arrange(<column_name>, <column_name>) function.\n\nPISA_2018 %>%\n  select(CNT, ST004D01T, PV1MATH) %>%\n  arrange(PV1MATH)\n\n# A tibble: 612,004 × 3\n   CNT             ST004D01T PV1MATH\n   <fct>           <fct>       <dbl>\n 1 Philippines     Female       24.7\n 2 Jordan          Male         51.0\n 3 Jordan          Female       61.6\n 4 Mexico          Female       64.3\n 5 Kazakhstan      Male         70.4\n 6 Jordan          Male         70.7\n 7 Bulgaria        Male         73.4\n 8 Kosovo          Male         76.0\n 9 North Macedonia Female       78.3\n10 North Macedonia Male         81.2\n# … with 611,994 more rows\n\n\nIf we’re interested in the highest achieving students we can add the desc() function to arrange:\n\nPISA_2018 %>%\n  select(CNT, LANGN, ST004D01T, PV1MATH) %>%\n  arrange(desc(PV1MATH))\n\n# A tibble: 612,004 × 4\n   CNT                  LANGN                  ST004D01T PV1MATH\n   <fct>                <fct>                  <fct>       <dbl>\n 1 Canada               Another language (CAN) Male         888.\n 2 Canada               Another language (CAN) Male         874.\n 3 United Arab Emirates English                Male         865.\n 4 B-S-J-Z (China)      Mandarin               Female       864.\n 5 Australia            English                Male         863.\n 6 B-S-J-Z (China)      Mandarin               Male         861.\n 7 Serbia               Serbian                Male         860.\n 8 Singapore            Invalid                Female       849.\n 9 Australia            Cantonese              Male         845.\n10 Canada               French                 Female       842.\n# … with 611,994 more rows\n\n\n\n2.10.7 Bring everyting together\nWe know that the evidence strongly indicates that repeating a year is not good for student progress, but how do countries around the world differ in terms of the percentage of their students who repeat a year?\n\ndata_repeat <- PISA_2018 %>%\n  filter(!is.na(REPEAT)) %>%\n  group_by(CNT) %>%\n  mutate(total = n()) %>%\n  select(CNT, REPEAT, total) %>%\n  group_by(CNT, REPEAT) %>%\n  summarise(student_n = n(),\n            total = unique(total),\n            per = student_n / unique(total)) %>%\n  filter(REPEAT == \"Repeated a  grade\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(per))\n\nprint(data_repeat)\n\nwrite_csv(data_repeat, \"<folder_location>/repeat_a_year.csv\")\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 77 × 5\n# Groups:   CNT [77]\n   CNT                REPEAT            student_n total   per\n   <fct>              <fct>                 <int> <int> <dbl>\n 1 Morocco            Repeated a  grade      3333  6666 0.5  \n 2 Colombia           Repeated a  grade      2746  7185 0.382\n 3 Lebanon            Repeated a  grade      1580  4756 0.332\n 4 Uruguay            Repeated a  grade      1657  5049 0.328\n 5 Luxembourg         Repeated a  grade      1655  5168 0.320\n 6 Dominican Republic Repeated a  grade      1694  5474 0.309\n 7 Brazil             Repeated a  grade      3227 10438 0.309\n 8 Macao              Repeated a  grade      1135  3773 0.301\n 9 Belgium            Repeated a  grade      2351  8089 0.291\n10 Costa Rica         Repeated a  grade      1904  6571 0.290\n# … with 67 more rows\n\n\n\nLine 2, filter out any NA values in the REPEAT field\nLine 3, group on the country of student CNT\n\nLine 4, create a new column total for total number of rows n() in each country CNT grouping\nLine 5, select on the CNT, REPEAT and total columns\nLine 6, regroup the data on country CNT and whether a student has repeated a year REPEAT, i.e. Albania+Did not repeat a grade; Albania+Repeated a grade; etc.\nLine 7, using the above grouping, count the number of rows in each group n() and assign this to student_n\n\nLine 8, for each grouping keep the total number of students in each country, as calculated on line 4.

To do this we need to look at how we can recode values. A common way to recode values is through an ifelse statement:\n\nifelse(<statement(s)>, <value_if_true>, <value_if_false>)\n\nifelse allows us to recode the data. In the example below, we are going to add a new column to the PISA_2018 dataset (using mutate) noting whether a student got a higher grade in their Maths PV1MATH or Reading PV1READ tests. if PV1MATH is bigger then PV1READ, the maths_better is TRUE, else maths_better is FALSE, or in dplyr format:\n\nmaths_data <- PISA_2018 %>%\n  mutate(maths_better = \n           ifelse(PV1MATH > PV1READ,\n                  TRUE, \n                  FALSE)) %>%\n  select(CNT, ST004D01T, maths_better, PV1MATH, PV1READ)\n\nprint(maths_data)\n\n# A tibble: 612,004 × 5\n   CNT     ST004D01T maths_better PV1MATH PV1READ\n   <fct>   <fct>     <lgl>          <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 Albania Male      TRUE            490.    376.\n 2 Albania Male      TRUE            462.    434.\n 3 Albania Female    TRUE            407.    359.\n 4 Albania Male      TRUE            483.    425.\n 5 Albania Male      TRUE            460.    306.\n 6 Albania Female    TRUE            367.    352.\n 7 Albania Female    FALSE           411.    413.\n 8 Albania Male      TRUE            441.    271.\n 9 Albania Female    TRUE            506.    373.\n10 Albania Female    FALSE           412.    412.\n# … with 611,994 more rows\n\n\nWe now take this new dataset maths_data and look at whether the difference between relative performance in maths and reading is the same for girls and boys:\n\nmaths_data %>% \n  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T), !is.na(maths_better)) %>%\n  group_by(ST004D01T, maths_better) %>%\n  summarise(n = n()) \n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n# Groups:   ST004D01T [2]\n  ST004D01T maths_better      n\n  <fct>     <lgl>         <int>\n1 Female    FALSE        176021\n2 Female    TRUE         126157\n3 Male      FALSE        110269\n4 Male      TRUE         194178\n\n\n\nAdjust the code above to work out the percentages of Males and Females ST004D01T in each group.

Take this example. Let’s flag students who have a different home language LANGN to the language that is being used in the PISA assessment tool LANGTEST_QQQ. We make an assumption here that the assessment tool will be the language used at school, so these students will be learning in a different language to their mother tongue. if LANGN equals LANGTEST_QQQ, the lang_diff is FALSE, else lang_diff is TRUE, this raises an error:\n\nlang_data <- PISA_2018 %>%\n  mutate(lang_diff = \n           ifelse(LANGN == LANGTEST_QQQ,\n                  FALSE, \n                  TRUE)) %>%\n  select(CNT, lang_diff, LANGTEST_QQQ, LANGN)\n\nError in `mutate()`:\n!

To fix this, all we need to do is cast the factors LANGN and LANGTEST_QQQ as characters using as.character(<field>). This will then allow the comparison of the text stored in each row:\n\nlang_data <- PISA_2018 %>%\n  mutate(lang_diff = \n           ifelse(as.character(LANGN) == as.character(LANGTEST_QQQ),\n                  FALSE, \n                  TRUE)) %>%\n  select(CNT, lang_diff, LANGTEST_QQQ, LANGN)\n\nprint(lang_data)\n\n# A tibble: 612,004 × 4\n   CNT     lang_diff LANGTEST_QQQ LANGN                 \n   <fct>   <lgl>     <fct>        <fct>                 \n 1 Albania TRUE      Albanian     Another language (ALB)\n 2 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian              \n 3 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian              \n 4 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian              \n 5 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian              \n 6 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian              \n 7 Albania NA        <NA>         Missing               \n 8 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian              \n 9 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian              \n10 Albania NA        <NA>         Missing               \n# … with 611,994 more rows\n\n\nWe can now look at this dataset to get an idea of which countries have the largest percentage of students learning in a language other than their mother tongue:\n\nlang_data_diff <- lang_data %>% \n  group_by(CNT) %>%\n  mutate(student_n = n()) %>%\n  group_by(CNT, lang_diff) %>%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            percentage = 100*(n / max(student_n))) %>%\n    filter(!is.na(lang_diff),\n         lang_diff == TRUE)\n\nprint(lang_data_diff)\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 4\n# Groups:   CNT [80]\n   CNT                    lang_diff     n percentage\n   <fct>                  <lgl>     <int>      <dbl>\n 1 Albania                TRUE        284       4.47\n 2 United Arab Emirates   TRUE       8195      42.5 \n 3 Argentina              TRUE        651       5.44\n 4 Australia              TRUE       2238      15.7 \n 5 Austria                TRUE       1329      19.5 \n 6 Belgium                TRUE       2458      29.0 \n 7 Bulgaria               TRUE        747      14.1 \n 8 Bosnia and Herzegovina TRUE        526       8.12\n 9 Belarus                TRUE        248       4.27\n10 Brazil                 TRUE        297       2.78\n# … with 70 more rows\n\n\nThis looks like a promising dataset, but there are some strange results:\n\nlang_data_diff %>% filter(percentage > 92)\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 4\n# Groups:   CNT [9]\n  CNT             lang_diff     n percentage\n  <fct>           <lgl>     <int>      <dbl>\n1 Hong Kong       TRUE       5880       97.4\n2 Lebanon         TRUE       5339       95.1\n3 Macao           TRUE       3683       97.6\n4 Montenegro      TRUE       6411       96.2\n5 Norway          TRUE       5813      100  \n6 Philippines     TRUE       6823       94.3\n7 B-S-J-Z (China) TRUE      12049       99.9\n8 Singapore       TRUE       6666       99.9\n9 Ukraine         TRUE       5597       93.3\n\n\nExploring data for Ukraine, we can see that a different spelling has been used in each field, Ukrainian and Ukranain.\n\nlang_data %>% filter(CNT == \"Ukraine\")\n\n# A tibble: 5,998 × 4\n   CNT     lang_diff LANGTEST_QQQ LANGN    \n   <fct>   <lgl>     <fct>        <fct>    \n 1 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 2 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 3 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 4 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Russian  \n 5 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 6 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Russian  \n 7 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 8 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 9 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Russian  \n10 Ukraine TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n# … with 5,988 more rows\n\n\nifelse can help here too.

R is there to help by assigning datatypes to each field. We have different sorts of data that can be stored:\n\n\n\nCategorical - data that can be divided into groups or categories\n\n\nNominal - categorical data where the order isn’t important, e.g. gender, or colours\n\nOrdinal - categorical data that may have order or ranking, e.g. exam grades (A, B, C, D) or lickert scales (strongly agree, agree, disgaree, strongly disagree)\n\n\n\nNumeric - data that consists of numbers\n\n\nContinuous - numeric data that can take any value within a given range, e.g. height (178cm, 134.54cm)\n\nDiscrete - numeric data that can take only certain values within a range, e.g. number of children in a family (0,1,2,3,4,5)\n\n\n\nBut here we are going to look at how R handles factors. Factors have two parts, levels and codes. levels are what you see when you view a table column, codes are an underlying order to the data. Factors allow you to store data that has a known set of values taht you might want to display in an order other than alphabetical. For example, if we look at the month field ST003D02T using the levels(<field>) command:\n\nlevels(PISA_2018$ST003D02T)\n\n [1] \"January\"        \"February\"       \"March\"          \"April\"         \n [5] \"May\"            \"June\"           \"July\"           \"August\"        \n [9] \"September\"      \"October\"        \"November\"       \"December\"      \n[13] \"Valid Skip\"     \"Not Applicable\" \"Invalid\"        \"No Response\"   \n\n\nWe can see that the months of the year are there along with other possible levels. With this particular dataset, we have set all other levels as NA.\nCodes are the underlying numbers/order for each level, in this case 1 = January, 2 = February, etc.\n\nas.numeric(PISA_2018$ST003D02T)\n\n [1]  2  7  4  4  3  2  7  8  3  7 12  1 12  6  3 12  3  6  8 12  7  8  8  9 10\n[26] 11  6  4  9  4  1  2  9  5 12  5  1  2 10  9\n [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 611964 entries ]\n\n\nHow can this be useful? A good example is how plots are made, they will use the codes to give an order to the display of columns, in the plot below, February (2) comes before March (3), even though there were more students born in March:\n\ngrph_data <- PISA_2018 %>% \n         group_by(ST003D02T) %>% \n         summarise(n=n())\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nTo re-order the columns to match the number of students, we can either try to do this manually, which is rather cumbersome:\n\nmy_levels <- c(\"July\", \"September\", \"January\", \"March\", \"February\",\"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"August\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\", \"Valid Skip\", \"Not Applicable\", \"Invalid\", \"No Response\")\n\ngrph_data$ST003D02T <- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nOr get R to do this for us:\n\n# get the levels in order and pull/create a vector of them\nmy_levels <- grph_data %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% pull(ST003D02T)\n\n# reassign the re-ordered levels to the dataframe column\ngrph_data$ST003D02T <- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nTo learn a lot more about factors, see Hadley’s chapter"

    "section": "\n3.1 Introduction to graphing in R",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction to graphing in R\nThe tidyverse includes the incredibly powerful ggplot2 package. This package is pretty much the industry standard for making graphs for publication. ggplot2 is built on the grammar of graphics where you build graphs by specifying underlying attributes and layering geometric objects on top of each other. In the diagram below you can see how a graph is built from geometric objects (the things that are plotted such as points and bars) a scale, and plot annotations (e.g. a key, title etc). You can then apply faceting to the graph to automatically split one graph into multiple plots, allowing you to easily compare different groupings. Publications, such as the Financial Times, make daily use of ggplot2.\n\n\nAdapted from A Layered Grammar of Graphics, Wickham, 2010\n\n\nThe basic structure of ggplot code is to combine different graphing elements through the use of the + operator. To demonstrate this, let’s look at the relationship between a poverty indicator ESCS and the performance in Maths PV1MATH, by gender ST004D01T and country CNT:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# wrangle our data\ngraph_data <- PISA_2018 %>% \n  filter(CNT %in% c(\"France\", \"United Kingdom\"))\n\n# display a graph of the results\nggplot(data = graph_data, \n       aes(x = ESCS, y = PV1MATH, colour = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ CNT) +\n  ggtitle(\"Comparison of poverty indicator and Maths result, by gender and country\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\nHopefully you can work out what lines 1-3 do from the previous chapter, let’s focus on the ggplot commands:\n\n6-7 these lines set up the ggplot giving it the table object graph_data as its data input and setting up the aesthetics for the rest of the graph elements using columns from graph_data. The aes(<attribute>, <attribute>, ...) command allows us to specify aesthetic elements of the graph that will change dependent on the dataset we use. In the PISA_2018 data set, the variable ESCS refers to an index of economic status, and PV1Math, is the plausible value of the mathematics score. We set the x and y variables x=ESCS and y=PV1MATH , defining aes() inside ggplot() means we will pass down these values to subsequent geometric objects so we don’t have to define these x and y axis items again and again.\n8 using the data and aes values defined on lines 6-7, geom_point uses the x and y values defined on line 19 to draw a point for each school in our dataset. There are lots of different parameters we could give geom_point e.g. specifying size and shape, but here we are content with using the defaults.\n9 we add another geometric object on top of the points, this time we add a line of best fit geom_smooth, again this geometric object uses the values specified on lines 6-7, and we define the method as lm, to calculate a linear model line of best fit.\n10 next we use facet_wrap(. ~ CNT) to create a graph for each group of CNT in the dataset, i.e. a graph for each country defined on line 3.\n11 finally we customise the title of the graph, ggtitle, ready for display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSwitching between the pipes and ggplot can get rather confusing. A very common mistake in using ggplot is to try and link together the geom_ elements with a pipe command %>% rather than the +."

    "text": "3.2 Geoms\nThere are about 40 different geometric objects in ggplot, allowing you to create almost any sort of graph. We will be exploring a few of them in detail, but if you want to explore others, please follow some of the links below:\n\n\ngeom_bar for creating bar charts and histograms\n\ngeom_point for plotting single points\n\ngeom_line for connecting points together and showing trends\n\ngeom_text for adding text labels to data points\n\ngeom_boxplot for representing the range of data\n\ngeom_hex for creating heat maps\n\ngeom_map for adding geographic maps\n\ngeom_smooth for adding lines of best fit\n\ngeom_hline for adding static horizontal lines to a graph\n\ngeom_vline for adding static vertical lines to a graph\n\n\n3.2.1 geom_point\nRather unsurprisingly, geom_point allows us to plot a layer of points using x and y coordinates. The below example shows how we can specify within the ggplot function data=school_plot_data. We then define the aesthetic attributes of the graph, passing the x x=NumberOfBoys and y y=NumberOfGirls values. Once these have been declared in the ggplot(...) function, their values are passed down to any subsequent geom_, in this case geom_point will use the data and x and y values that have been specified in ggplot(...)\n\n# create a new dataframe of maths and reading scores by country and OECD status\ncountry_plot_data <- PISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %>%\n  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH),\n            mean_read = mean(PV1READ),\n            sz = n())\n\n# using this new dataframe, show the relationship between maths and reading score\n# using geom_points\nggplot(data=country_plot_data, \n       aes(x=mean_maths, y=mean_read)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size=sz, colour=OECD), alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line 2 above we pipe the large data.frame PISA_2018 to apply a number of functions.\nLine 3 groups by OECD (a Yes or No indicating membership) and CNT (the name of the country).\nLines 4-5 calculate the mean mathematics and reading score, and create new variables (mean_maths, and mean_read) for their values.\nIn addition, in line 6, the variables sz is created which counts the number of responses per country through the n() command.\nThis whole pipe is then saved to the country_plot_data object, using the <- on line 2\n\nThis new dataframe is then passed to ggplot.\n\nIn line 10, we specify the data that should be plotted - the new dataframe country_plot_data we have created.\nLine 11, then we pass the x and y variables, mean_maths, and mean_read, inside the aesthetic function. These values will be passed to any subsequent geom_\n\nIn line 12, we make a number of tweaks to the points: first setting the aesthetics - the size of the points is linked to the sz variable we created, the number of responses per country, and the colour is linked to OECD membership. Finally (and note this is outside the aes brackets, we set an alpha value which makes the point slightly transparent, which is more visually appealing where points overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDefining things inside aes mean that they will change with the dataset you use, if you define them outside aes then they will be constant values. For example\n\n# plotting number of boys as x, number of girls as y and % disadvantged as size,\n# all inside aes, so each point is a table row\nggplot(data=PISA_2018_school) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = SC002Q01TA,\n                 y = SC002Q02TA,\n                 size=SC048Q03NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n# there is an error if we put size outside the aes, and set it a value from the \n# dataset, it can't find value!\nggplot(data=PISA_2018_school) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = SC002Q01TA,\n                 y = SC002Q02TA),\n             size=SC048Q03NA)\n\nError in list2(na.rm = na.rm, ...): object 'SC048Q03NA' not found\n\n\n\n# but if we set the size explicitly, outside the aes, then all points will be that size\nggplot(data=PISA_2018_school) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = SC002Q01TA,\n                 y = SC002Q02TA),\n             size=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Questions\n\n\nSpot the three errors in this graph code\n\n\nggplot(adta=diamonds, x=depth, y=price) +\n  geom_point() %>% \n  ggtitle(\"diamond graph\")\n\n\nanswer#1 data not adta; #2 x and y need to be inside aes\nggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=depth, y=price)) +\n  geom_point() + #3 %>% instead of +\n  ggtitle(\"diamond graph\")\n\n\n\nUsing the PISA_2018 dataset, plot a graph for students from Norway to look at the relationship between wealth WEALTH and reading grade PV1READ. Colour each point with the gender ST004D01T of the student. Give the graph sensible x and y labels (e.g. xlab(\"label\")).\n\n\nanswer dataframegraph_data <- PISA_2018 %>% filter(CNT == \"Norway\")\n\n\n\nanswer graphggplot(graph_data,\n       aes(x=WEALTH,\n           y=PV1READ)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour=ST004D01T)) +\n  xlab(\"Wealth\") +\n  ylab(\"Reading grade\")\n\n\n\nUsing the PISA_2018 dataset for each country CNT, create a graph to explore how the median of the sense of school belonging BELONG relates to the median of the disciplinary climate in the school DISCLIMA, adjust the colour of each point to reflect the mean wealth of students in each country ESCS.\n\nHINT: You’ll need create a new dataframe with summarised variables for median_belong, median_discipline and mean_wealth.\n\nanswer dataframegraph_data <- PISA_2018 %>%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %>%\n  summarise(median_belong = median(BELONG, na.rm=TRUE),\n            median_discipline = median(DISCLIMA, na.rm=TRUE),\n            mean_wealth = mean(ESCS, na.rm=TRUE))\n\n\nHINT: To make your colours stand out more, add + scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(3)) to the end of your plot.\n\nanswer graph# display a graph of the results\nggplot(data = graph_data, \n       aes(x = median_belong, \n           y = median_discipline)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = mean_wealth)) + \n  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(3))\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 geom_bar\nThe geom_bar function is versatile, allowing the creation of bar, multiple bar, stacked bar charts and histograms. This first example shows how we can use bar charts to represent the number of cars in a household ST012Q02TA:\n\nplot_cars <- PISA_2018 %>% filter(!is.na(ST012Q02TA))\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST012Q02TA)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n2 gets the PISA_2018 dataset and removes all rows where ST012Q02TA is NA, storing this new dataset as plot_cars\n\n4 passes the plot_cars to ggplot, as the dataset we are going to plot\n5 specifies the x values to be the values stored in ST012Q02TA, i.e. we will have a bar for each response given in ST012Q02TA: None, One, Two, Three or more.\n6 geom_bar tell ggplot to make bars, it uses the aesthetic from line 5, to plot the x axis, note we haven’t given it a y value, this is auto-calculated from the number of students in each x group.\n\nWe can choose to let ggplot split the results into different groups for us by setting a fill option, in this case on the OECD status of the country, i.e. do students in OECD countries have more cars than those not in OECD countries, to do this, we add fill=OECD to the aes on line 2 below:\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST012Q02TA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bars are now coloured with a key, but, annoyingly, the bars are on top of each other not easily allowing us to make direct comparisons. To compare different groups we need the bars to not be stacked, we want them next to each other, or in ggplot language, we want the bars to dodge each other, to do this we add the position=position_dodge() command to line 3 below:\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST012Q02TA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge())\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.1 Raising the bars yourself\nggplot can do a lot of the hard work when putting together bar charts, e.g. counting the number of students in each group, but there might also be times when you want to use pipes to calculate summary values that you then want plot. That is, you want to specify the heights of the bars yourself. To do this we will specify the y axis in the aes and use stat=\"indentity\" to tell ggplot that’s what we’re doing. Take the example where you want to find the overall percentage of students for a range of countries getting over 500 in PV1SCIE:\n\nplot_data <- PISA_2018 %>%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %>%\n  summarise(all_students = n(),\n            upper_sci_per = sum(PV1SCIE > 500) / n())\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=CNT, y=upper_sci_per)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=OECD), \n           position=position_dodge(),\n           stat=\"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n1 to 4 creates a dataframe plot_data that calculates the percentage of students in each country CNT, that have a science grade PV1SCIE over 500\n\n7 as we are setting the heights of the bars ourselves, we need to give the ggplot aes command a y value, in this case y=upper_sci_per\n\n8 the geom_bar is given a fill value of OECD, this will allow us to see how countries in and out of the OECD compare\n9 we use position=position_dodge() as we want the percentage grades of each country to be next to each other so we can look for differences in heights\n10 stat=\"identity\" tells geom_bar that you have defined your own bar heights in the y attribute and not to count the number of rows.\n11 this theme command helps rotate the x-axis labels 90 degrees, so they don’t overlap.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the geom_col() function that can handle you setting the y values and not specifying stat=\"identity\"\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=CNT, y=upper_sci_per)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill=OECD), \n           position=position_dodge()) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n3.2.4 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the 4 errors in this code.\n\n\nggplot(data=schools %>% filter(Phase == \"Secondary\"), \n       x=Region +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=Gender) position=\"full\") \n\n\nanswerggplot(data=schools %>% filter(Phase == \"Secondary\"), \n       aes(x=Region)) + # 1 no aes() around the x value # 2 missing close brackets\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=Gender), position=\"fill\") # 3 missing comma # 4 position=\"full\" rather than fill \n\n\n\nCreate a bar chart showing the total number of students for each grouping of “Think about your school, how true: Students seem to value competition” ST205Q01HA.

Better would be for us to have numbers listed at the top of each bar by adding a geom_text element:\n\nplot_cars <- PISA_2018 %>% filter(!is.na(ST012Q02TA))\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST012Q02TA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +\n  geom_text(stat='count', \n            aes(label=..count..), \n            position = position_dodge(width=0.9),\n            vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nline 6 starts the geom_text command, telling the geom to use the count statistic from ggplot, this means it will be able to fetch the number of rows in each grouping.\nline 7 as we want the label to change for each bar element, we put label=..count.. inside aes. The x location of the labels is inherited from line 4 and the y location will be calculated from the height of each bar\nline 8 we want the labels to align to the bars, so we tell the geom_text to also position_dodge, passing a width=0.9 to the dodge function, so the labels line up above the columns,\nfinally, on line 9, we vertically adjust the labels vjust, so they sit on top of the columns.\n\nRather than adding the count, you might want to add the percentage that each bar represents, we can do this by changing the value given to label on line 5, below:\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST012Q02TA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +\n  geom_text(stat='count', \n            aes(label=100*(..count../sum(..count..)) %>% round(3), \n            group = OECD), \n            position = position_dodge(width=0.9),\n            vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, when we make graphs we often want to label the dataset, for example if we were to plot all the countries and their PV1MATH and PV1READ scores, we would get:\n\nplot_data <- PISA_2018 %>%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %>%\n  summarise(m_read  = mean(PV1READ, na.rm=\"TRUE\"),\n            m_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=\"TRUE\"))\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\nThis looks great, but we don’t actually know which countries are which. To get this data we need to add text to the graph, using geom_text.\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(aes(label=CNT), \n            colour=\"black\", \n            check_overlap = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nHere we have used colour=\"black\" outside the aes to define the colour for all the labels, and check_overlap = TRUE which removes any labels that are on top of each other. It’s still a little bit hard to understand, and maybe we want to focus on just a few of the labels for countries we are interested in. For example\n\n# make a vector of countries you want to have labels for\nfocus_cnt <- c(\"United Kingdom\", \"France\", \"Argentina\")\n\n# add a new column to the plot_data where these countries are\nplot_data <- plot_data %>% mutate(focus = CNT %in% focus_cnt)\n\nplot_data\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 5\n# Groups:   OECD [2]\n   OECD  CNT                    m_read m_maths focus\n   <fct> <fct>                   <dbl>   <dbl> <lgl>\n 1 No    Albania                  407.    438.

FALSE\n# … with 70 more rows\n\n\nNow we can adjust out geom_text to only show those countries that we want to focus on:\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(data=plot_data %>% filter(focus == TRUE),\n            aes(label=CNT), \n            colour=\"black\", \n            check_overlap = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nline 5 changes the data that is being passed to the geom_text, it no longer uses the data defined in line 2, but has a new dataset, that is filtered on focus == TRUE, i.e. only containing the countries that we want.\nNote that the x and y mappings from line 3 are inherited by line 6, it’s only the data that we have redefined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ngeom_text is great, but you might find that ggrepel package useful as it’ll add lines connecting the text the data points. Using the plot_data from above:\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text_repel(data=plot_data %>% filter(focus == TRUE),\n            aes(label=CNT),\n            box.padding = 0.5,\n            max.overlaps = Inf,\n            colour=\"black\")\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`)."

    "text": "4.1 Seminar activities\n\n4.1.1 Discussion activity\nBased on Davis (2013) Link to chapter\n\nConsider how and why we think of things as being ‘normal’ (or not). Some suggested questions are:\n\nWhat were your immediate thoughts on reading this paper?\nIn what ways have you yourself been aware of being compared to norms or ideals?\nHow do you feel about that? As an education professional, have you made comparisons between individual students and expected norms or averages? Between groups of students?\nWhen and how was this useful?\nWhen and how was this problematic?\n\n4.1.2 Tasks\nGetting set up\nUsing the following .csv data set and the read.csv command: DfE_SEN_School_Level to load data on Special Educational Needs (SEN) students in UK schools.\n\n# Descriptive Statistics using the DfE SEN School Level Data\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nloc <- \"<your drive>/sen_school_level_underlying_data.csv\"\nDfE_SEN_data <- read.csv(loc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may find these explanation of acronyms used in the spreadsheet useful:\n\nLA stands for local authority and is an administrative region, for example, Camden and Greenwich.\nFSM refers to students who receive free school means - this funding is available for students whose parents or carers receive certain government benefits, typically due to relatively low income. It is taken, by some policy makers and researchers, as a marker of socioeconomic disadvantage\nSEN support indicates a school has made a judgement that a student needs further support in school because of special educational needs or disabilities, for example dyslexia or speech and communication needs. If students need a higher level of support, they can be assessed by a specialist and are then placed on an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Students on EHC plans receive a higher level of support than those on SEN support.\nA Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) is a type of school for children who are not able to attend a mainstream school due to illness or behavioural issues that have led to being excluded.\nA special school is a school that provides support for students with special educational needs, for example, autism or physical disabilities, like deafness.\nEHC_primary_need_spld = specific learning difficulties, for example, dyslexia and dyspraxia\nEHC_primary_need_mld = moderate learning difficulties, indicating a delay in development\nEHC_primary_need_sld = severe learning difficulties, indicating significant learning needs\nEHC_primary_need_pmld = profound and multiple learning difficulties - students with multiple and complex needs\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.1 Descriptive statistics\nWe will now learn how to calculate means of subgroups of schools using the filter and summarise functions. We can use filter to focus on only a subset of our data.frame. For example, below, we choose to focus on schools in Camden.\nIn line 3 below, we focus on schools in Camden. Note that, in filter we use ==. Then we use summarise to calculate the totals of the variables we are interested in, students getting SEN support (SEN.support), students on an EHC plan (EHC.plan) and the total (Total.Pupils).\n\n# Selecting only schools in one LA and finding the mean of various variables\n\nDfE_SEN_data %>% \n  filter(la_name == \"Camden\") %>% # Filter to only include schools in Camden (note the ==)\n  summarise(SEN_total=sum(SEN.support), \n            EHCplan=sum(EHC.plan), \n            Total=sum(Total.pupils))\n\n  SEN_total EHCplan Total\n1      4389    1107 31622\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to filter by a different vector (that is, a different column in the table), don’t forget to change the name of the vector in the filter command, for example, to filter by the gender of pupils at the school. Don’t forget to use the %>% and the == in filter!\n\nDfE_SEN_data %>% \n filter(sex_of_school_description==\"Boys\")%>%\n  summarise(SEN_total=sum(SEN.support), \n            EHCplan=sum(EHC.plan), \n            Total=sum(Total.pupils))\n\n  SEN_total EHCplan  Total\n1     22028    7451 217220\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.2 Task 1\n\n\nFind the total number of students with SEN support, on EHC plans, and the total number of students (using Total.pupils) in Greenwich\n\n\nAnswer# Selecting only schools in one LA and finding the mean of various variables\n\nDfE_SEN_data %>% \n  filter(la_name==\"Greenwich\") %>% \n  summarise(SEN_total=sum(SEN.support), \n            EHCplan=sum(EHC.plan), \n            Total=sum(Total.pupils))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMake sure you have spelled the name of the variables SEN.support, etc. correctly. They are case sensitive. You can use the function colnames(DfE_SEN_data) to get a list of names and copy and paste them\n\n\n\n4.1.2.3 Task 2\n\n\nSelect a single local authority (LA) or region.\nCalculate the total number of pupils in the LA, the total number listed as receiving SEN support, and the total number with an EHC plan.\n\n\nAnswer# Selecting only schools in Hackney and finding the total pupils on SEN support and EHC plans\n\nDfE_SEN_data %>% \n  filter(la_name==\"Hackney\") %>% \n  summarise(SEN_total=sum(SEN.support), \n            EHCplan=sum(EHC.plan))\n\n\n\nCalculate the totals for all of London (note, you will need to change the name of the column you are filtering by).\n\n\nAnswer# Filter for London  schools and finding the total pupils on SEN support and EHC plans\n\nDfE_SEN_data %>% \n  filter(region_name==\"London\") %>% \n  summarise(SEN_total=sum(SEN.support), \n            EHCplan=sum(EHC.plan))\n\n\n\nAn extension task - use the functions mean() to calculate mean values, and sd() to calculate standard deviation in the summarise functions above, in Camden schools.\n\n\nAnswer# Filter for London schools and finding the mean and standard deviation of pupils on SEN support and EHC plans\n\nDfE_SEN_data %>% \n  filter(region_name==\"London\") %>% \n  summarise(SENmean=mean(SEN.support), \n            EHCmean=mean(EHC.plan),\n            SENsd=sd(SEN.support),\n            EHCsd=sd(EHC.plan))\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.4 Calculating Percentages\nNext, we will use the totals of SEN supported and EHC plan students to calculate percentages. We simply do an additional summarise with the equation to find the percentage of EHCplan students =(EHCplan/Total)*100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen using summarise, be careful to add a comma after each function, and check you have closed as many brackets as you open!\n\n\n\n# Descriptive Statistics using the DfE SEN School Level Data\n\n# Calculating Percentages of students on EHC plans\nPercenttable <- DfE_SEN_data  %>% \n  group_by(district_administrative_name) %>%\n  summarise(SEN_support = sum(SEN.support), \n            EHCplan     = sum(EHC.plan), \n            Total       = sum(Total.pupils),\n            percentageEHCplan = (EHCplan/Total)*100) \n\nprint(Percenttable)\n\n# A tibble: 310 × 5\n   district_administrative_name SEN_support EHCplan Total percentageEHCplan\n   <chr>                              <int>   <int> <int>             <dbl>\n 1 Adur                                1427     350  9315              3.76\n 2 Allerdale                           1701     523 14994              3.49\n 3 Amber Valley                        2409     823 18819              4.37\n 4 Arun                                2621     556 18742              2.97\n 5 Ashfield                            2485     420 20140              2.09\n 6 Ashford                             2357    1280 22832              5.61\n 7 Babergh                             1910     675 15097              4.47\n 8 Barking and Dagenham                5286    1570 45153              3.48\n 9 Barnet                              7269    2505 68481              3.66\n10 Barnsley                            3849    1579 35271              4.48\n# … with 300 more rows\n\n\nThis gives a table as an output, with the percentage of students on an EHC plan in each local authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the signif function to display a given number of decimal places.

I have called that data.frame genderplot (the data about percentage of students on EHC plans by gender, that I will plot). Then, I take the main data.frame and group_by sex_of_school_description, to get the schools grouped by whether they are single of mixed sex. Next I use the mutate function to create percentage columns, as we did before.\nThe new element here is using ggplot, R’s graphing function (more details on how to use geom_bar are in the section above: Geom_bar).\nTo plot a graph, you call ggplot and specify the data you want to use for the graph (in our case, the new data.frame we have created, genderplot).\nThe next layer of ggplot is the aesthetics (aes), i.e., what our graph will look like. First, we tell ggplot what we want our x (sex_of_school_description) and y (percentageEHCplan) variables to be. Finally, we use geom_col() to plot a column graph.\n\n# Presenting % on EHC by gender of school\ngenderplot <- DfE_SEN_data %>%\n  group_by(sex_of_school_description) %>%\n  summarise(SEN_support=sum(SEN.support), \n            EHCplan=sum(EHC.plan), \n            Total=sum(Total.pupils),\n            percentageEHCplan = (EHCplan/Total)*100, \n            percentagesupport = (SEN_support/Total)*100)\n\n\n# using the genderplot data create a graph\nggplot(data=genderplot,\n       aes(x=sex_of_school_description,\n           y=percentageEHCplan)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4.1 Task 5\n\nPlot a column graph of the % of students of EHC.plans by the type of school (the type_of_establishment variable)\n\nAnswer# Calculate percentage on plan and support by type of school\n\nestabdata <- DfE_SEN_data %>%\n  group_by(type_of_establishment) %>%\n  summarise(EHCplan=sum(EHC.plan), \n            Total=sum(Total.pupils),\n            percentageEHCplan = (EHCplan/Total)*100)\n\n# Plot the type of school data\nggplot(data=estabdata,\n       aes(x=type_of_establishment,\n           y=percentageEHCplan)) +\n  geom_col(fill=\"red\")+ # I have filled the columns in red here\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) \n  # The final line rotates the text and spaces it nicely\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Scatter Graphs\nTo plot a scatter graph we use the geom_point (see also: Geom_Point section), which works in a similar way to geom_col.\nExample\nImagine I want to plot a graph of total number of students (on the x-axis) against those with EHC plans (y-axis) for all schools in London.\nA above, I first want to create a data.frame to plot - in this case I have called it plotdata. I filter to select only London schools from the DfE dataset.\nThen I pass ggplot plotdata. As with geom_col, I use ggplot and first specify the data I want to plot (ggplot(data=plotdata,). Next, I set the aesthetic variables, to keep things simple,only the x and y variables. Then I call geom_point to plot the points as a scatter graph.\n\n# Filter to create a dataframe of only London schools\nplotdata<-DfE_SEN_data %>%\n  filter(region_name==\"London\")\n# Plot the type of school data\nggplot(data=plotdata,\n       aes(x=Total.pupils,y=EHC.plan)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nWe can make things more pleasing by adding more features to the aesthetic variable. For example, I can add colour (geom_point(colour=\"blue\")) and rename the axes labs(x=\"Total number of pupils\", y=\"Number of pupils on EHC plans\"). Note when adding to ggplot, the + should come at the end of the line before the new addition to avoid an error.\n\n#  Filter to create a dataframe of only London schools\nplotdata<-DfE_SEN_data %>%\n  filter(region_name==\"London\")\n# Plot the type of school data\nggplot(data=plotdata,\n       aes(x=Total.pupils,y=EHC.plan)) +\n  geom_point(colour=\"blue\")+\n  labs(x=\"Total number of pupils\", y=\"Number of pupils on EHC plans\")\n\n\n\n\nI can also add a line using (geom_smooth(method='lm')) - here ‘lm’ specifies a linear plot (i.e. a straight line).\n\n# Filtter to create a dataframe of only London schools\nplotdata<-DfE_SEN_data %>%\n  filter(region_name==\"London\")\n# Plot the type of school data\nggplot(data=plotdata,\n       aes(x=Total.pupils,y=EHC.plan)) +\n  geom_point(colour=\"blue\")+\n  labs(x=\"Total number of pupils\", y=\"Number of pupils on EHC plans\")+\n  (geom_smooth(method='lm'))\n\n\n\n\nI can also change the colour of the points by a variable in the dataframe - for example by the type of school (aes(colour=type_of_establishment)). I can vary the size of points and make them slightly transparent (their alpha level): geom_point(alpha=0.4, size=0.6), and I can move the legend to the bottom\n\n# Filter to create a dataframe of only London schools\nplotdata<-DfE_SEN_data %>%\n  filter(region_name==\"London\")\n# Plot the type of school data\nggplot(data=plotdata,\n       aes(x=Total.pupils,y=EHC.plan, colour=sex_of_school_description)) +\n  geom_point(alpha=0.4, size=0.6)+\n  labs(x=\"Total number of pupils\", y=\"Number of puupils on EHC plans\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor a summary of all the elements of a graph you can change in ggplot - see this help sheet\n\n\n\n4.1.5.1 Task 6\n\nFor schools in London, plot the number of students receiving SEN support (SEN.Support) against those on an EHC plan (EHC.plan).

I use cut(Total.pupils, breaks=seq(0,1500, 25)) to create a new vector (column in the table) with the total number of pupils divided up into bins. The specification breaks=seq(0,1500, 25)) sets how the data are broken up - into bins (i.e. groups of schools) of pupil numbers starting at 0 and rising to 1500 in steps of 25.\n\n# Creates distribution of schools by size\nbinnedsize <- DfE_SEN_data %>% # Creates a new data frame with binned data\n  mutate(Total.pupils = cut(Total.pupils, breaks=seq(0,1500, 25)))%>%\n  na.omit()\nggplot(binnedsize,\n       aes(x=Total.pupils)) +\n  geom_bar(fill=\"dark green\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  labs(y=\"Number of schools\", x=\"Pupil range\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a graph of the binned counts of number of students on SEN support in schools in the UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo find out a range of a vector, you can use the range function in the console - for example, to get a sense of the range of numbers of students on SEN support. I can type: range(DfE_SEN_data$SEN.support)\n\n\n\nAnswer# Creates distribution of those on SEN support\nbinnedSEN <- DfE_SEN_data %>% # Creates a new data frame with bins\n  mutate(SENbins = cut(SEN.support, breaks=seq(0,100, 2)))%>%\n  na.omit()\nggplot(binnedSEN,\n       aes(x=SENbins)) +\n  geom_bar(fill=\"dark green\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  labs(y=\"Number of schools\", x=\"Number on SEN support\")"

R will check this for you, and if they are unequal, will use the test for unequal variances (Welch’s test).\n\n\n\nAnswerBirminghamboys <- DfE_2019 %>%\n  select(Local_Authority_name, Gender_of_Entry, P8SCORE)%>%\n  filter(Local_Authority_name == \"Birmingham\" & \n         Gender_of_Entry==\"Boys\")\n\nBirminghamgirls<-DfE_2019 %>%\n  select(Local_Authority_name, Gender_of_Entry, P8SCORE)%>%\n  filter(Local_Authority_name ==\"Birmingham\" &\n         Gender_of_Entry==\"Girls\")\n\nshapiro.test(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE)\n#Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n#data:  Birminghamboys$P8SCORE\n#W = 0.85654, p-value = 0.05193\n\nshapiro.test(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE)\n#Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n#data:  Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE\n#W = 0.97786, p-value = 0.9675\n\nvarboys <- var(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE)\n\nvargirls <- var(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE)\n\nvarboys/vargirls\n#12.43959\n\nt.test(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE, Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE, var.equal=FALSE, alternative = 'two.sided')\n#Welch Two Sample t-test\n#data:  Birminghamboys$P8SCORE and Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE\n#t = -1.3796, df = 11.363, p-value = 0.1943\n#alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n#95 percent confidence interval:\n# -1.1825235  0.2690969\n#sample estimates:\n#mean of x mean of y \n#0.1263636 0.5830769 \n\n\n\nNow, filter out any outliers in the data for part a) i) and repeat the t-test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nChecking and Filtering for Outliers\nOften, we need to check and filter for outliers in the data. There are many ways to do this, depending on the distribution of the data and how extreme the outliers are that we want to remove. A good rule of thumb is the median +/- 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), where the IQR is the upper quartile - lower quartile. If the data is normally distributed, then the mean +/- 1.5 time the standard deviation (sd) can be used. If we only want to remove more extreme outliers, then 2 or even 3 times the IQR (or sd) from the median (or mean) can be used instead.\nOnce we have determined the upper and lower bound of our outliers, we can remove any data points that lie outside of this and then perform our statistical test on the data.\n\n\n\nAnsweroutl_h_b <- mean(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE) + 1.5 * sd(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE)\n\noutl_l_b <- mean(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE) - 1.5 * sd(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE)\n\n\n\noutl_h_g <- mean(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE) + 1.5 * sd(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE)\n\noutl_l_g <- mean(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE) - 1.5 * sd(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE)\n\n\n\nBirminghamboys <- Birminghamboys %>%\n  select(Local_Authority_name, Gender_of_Entry, P8SCORE)%>%\n  filter(P8SCORE > outl_l_b &\n           P8SCORE < outl_h_b)\n\nshapiro.test(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE)\n\n#Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\n#data:  Birminghamboys$P8SCORE\n#W = 0.94364, p-value = 0.5942\n\nshapiro.test(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE)\n#Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\n#data:  Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE\n#W = 0.97786, p-value = 0.9675\n\n\nvarboys <- var(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE)\n\nvargirls <- var(Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE)\n\nvarboys/vargirls\n#4.101412\n\n\nt.test(Birminghamboys$P8SCORE, Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE, \n       var.equal=FALSE, \n       alternative = 'two.sided')\n\n#Welch Two Sample t-test\n\n#data:  Birminghamboys$P8SCORE and Birminghamgirls$P8SCORE\n#t = -0.89463, df = 12.366, p-value = 0.3881\n#alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n#95 percent confidence interval:\n# -0.6446256  0.2684718\n#sample estimates:\n#mean of x mean of y \n#0.3950000 0.5830769 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplicate the t-test used in Example 3 of the lecture when comparing 2018 and 2019 data in Birmingham.

    "section": "\n7.1 Analysis of Variation (Anova)",
    "text": "7.1 Analysis of Variation (Anova)\nYou have now learned how to find if the means of two groups are different to a statistically significant degree - you use a t-test. However, t-tests are used to compare two groups. When more than two groups are compared, a different test is required, an analysis of variation or anova test.\nAnova refers to a collection of tests that can be used to analyse the difference in means between groups (hence analysis of variation, or anova for short). For example, consider the data below, which show students scores on a test, their age in years and socio-economic class (categorised as high or low):\n\n\nSocio\nAge\nScore\n\n\n\nHigh\n15\n100\n\n\nHigh\n16\n98\n\n\nHigh\n11\n89\n\n\nHigh\n15\n98\n\n\nLow\n11\n21\n\n\nHigh\n14\n31\n\n\nLow\n12\n23\n\n\nHigh\n16\n92\n\n\nHigh\n12\n99\n\n\nLow\n15\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that an assumption of an anova test is that the variables are normally distributed, and have equal variance. This is not the case with the small data sets in this example. They are a teaching illustration.\n\n\nWhich variable, age or socio-economic class, seems to explain the variation in test scores?\nWe can use anova to determine first if there is statistically significant variation in the mean scores of groups by class and age. Second an anova analysis can determine how much variation each variable (class and age) accounts for.\nYou can get a sense of this difference graphically by plotting graphs of the distribution of scores by socio-economic class:\n\nTestscores <- data.frame(socio=c(\"High\",\"High\",\"High\",\"High\",\"Low\",\"High\",\"Low\",\"High\",\"High\",\"Low\"),\n                       score=c(100,98,89,98,21,31,23,92,99,19),\n                       Age=c(15,16,11,15,11,14,12,16,12,15))\nggplot(Testscores,\n       aes(x=score, fill=socio))+\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like there might be a difference in the distribution of scores by those in different classes.\nFor age, we can sort into two groups, under 15, and 15 and over:\n\n# Testscores$Age[Testscores$Age>=15] <- \"Fifteen and over\"\n# Testscores$Age[Testscores$Age<15]  <- \"Under fifteen\"\nTestscores <- Testscores %>% \n  mutate(Age = ifelse(Age >= 15, \n                      \"Fifteen and over\", \n                      \"Under fifteen\"))\n  \nggplot(Testscores,\n       aes(x=score, fill=Age))+\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nThe difference is less clear here.\nTo determine if there is a statistically significant difference between groups we run an anova calculation, using the aov function in R. We pass the function the data we wish to focus on (Testscores) and then indicate we wish to look for variation in the score, by Age and socio (social class) - aov(data=Testscores, score ~ Age + socio). We then summarise the result to get a table.\n\nresaov<-aov(data=Testscores, score ~ Age + socio)\nsumresaov<-summary(resaov)\nsumresaov\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)   \nAge          1   2074    2074   4.707 0.06667 . \nsocio        1   7638    7638  17.338 0.00422 **\nResiduals    7   3084     441                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe resulting table has three rows: Age and socio (the two vectors we input to examine) and a third, residuals. The aov function looks to determine if there is variation in the means of groups of different ages (under fifteen and over) and class (high and low). After determining any variation in mean score from those two variables, any remaining variation is associated with residuals - you can think of this as the unexplained variation that isn’t associated with the vectors we specified (age and class).\nFirst, look at the Pr(>F) column. This is a test of significance and reports if the groups in that row show statistically significant variation. For example, Age returns Pr(>F) 0.07 - which is over 0.05 therefore there is no significant difference between the two age groups. However, for class, Pr(>F) is 0.00422** suggesting there is a significant difference by class.\nNow knowing that there are significant differences between the two class groups, we can next determine how much variation in the test score is explained by class. To do this we calculate a variable called eta-squared.\nEta-squared gives the proportion of variance explained by each variable. The eta squared function is in the package lsr so we will install lsr, and then use the result of our anova (resaov) to calculate Eta-squared using the function etaSquared. To report the value of eta as a percentage we need to multiply the output of eta by 100.\n\nlibrary(lsr)\neta<-as.data.frame(etaSquared(resaov))\neta<-eta*100\neta\n\n         eta.sq eta.sq.part\nAge    5.028982    17.26414\nsocio 59.694279    71.23853\n\n\nThe important column here is the eta.sq column - it tell us that age only explains 5% of the variance in test scores, but socioeconomic class, explains 60%. (The second column contains information about partial eta-squared, which we won’t go into, but are used when the results of each measure are not independent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, a percentage variance explained of 1% is considered small, 6% medium and 14% and more large\n\n\nWe can now apply anova to the PISA_2018. Let us focus on science scores (PV1SCIE).\nFirst, load the PISA data and create a data.frame containing the UK results for the vectors of science scores (PV1SCIE), parental wealth (WEALTH), gender (ST004D01T) and age (AGE).\n\nPISAUK <- PISA_2018 %>%\n select(CNT, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T, WEALTH, AGE)%>%\n filter(CNT==\"United Kingdom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTwo assumptions of anova tests are a) the normality of the groups and b) that the groups have equal variance. We can do those checks using the quantile-quantile plot of normality we have seen earlier, and the var function to find the variance.\n\nPISAUKmale   <- PISAUK %>% filter(ST004D01T==\"Male\")\nPISAUKFemale <- PISAUK %>% filter(ST004D01T==\"Female\")\n\nggqqplot(PISAUKmale$PV1SCIE)\n\n\n\nggqqplot(PISAUKFemale$PV1SCIE)\n\n\n\nvar=var(PISAUKmale$PV1SCIE)/var(PISAUKFemale$PV1SCIE)\nvar\n\n[1] 1.176446\n\n\nBoth plots come out as straight lines indicating normality. The ratio of variance is 1.2, close enough to equal variance to suggest the conditions for anova tests are met. The rule of thumb for equal variances is taken as anything less than 3:1.\n\n\nCurrently, the wealth scores are a numeric measure of family wealth, normalised around 0 (being the mean) and in the range of -0.935 to 1.20. To make the calculation simpler, we will categorise the scores into two groups, high wealth (over 0) and low wealth (0 or under). We will drop any NA values.\n\nPISAUK <- drop_na(PISAUK)\n\nPISAUK <- PISAUK %>% \n  mutate(WEALTH = ifelse(WEALTH > 0, \"High\", \"Low\"))\n\n# PISAUK$WEALTH<-replace(PISAUK$WEALTH,PISAUK$WEALTH>0, \"High\")\n# PISAUK$WEALTH<-replace(PISAUK$WEALTH,PISAUK$WEALTH<=0, \"Low\")\n\nTo visualise the difference in means, here are graphs of the science scores for the two wealth groups:\n\nggplot(PISAUK,\n       aes(x=PV1SCIE, fill=WEALTH))+\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nVisually, there appear to be some differences, the high wealth group seems to have a higher mean, but to determine if they are statistically significant, we need to run an anova test.\nBelow is code to run the anova, just like in the example with test scores. We use aov and specify the data set as PISAUK. Then we state we wish to compare the variance in science scores PV1SCIE, against gender (ST004D01T), wealth and age: PV1SCIE ~ ST004D01T + WEALTH + AGE.\nWe then summarise and print the table:\n\nresaov<-aov(PV1SCIE ~ ST004D01T + WEALTH + AGE, data=PISAUK)\nsumresaov<-summary(resaov)\nsumresaov\n\n               Df    Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    \nST004D01T       1      6200    6200   0.695    0.405    \nWEALTH          1   1038412 1038412 116.371  < 2e-16 ***\nAGE            13    610655   46973   5.264 1.66e-09 ***\nResiduals   13351 119134784    8923                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nNote that the p value for gender (ST004D01T) is 0.405, which is over 0.05, so there are no significant differences by gender. By contrast, for WEALTH and AGE, the p values are below the 0.05 cut off, so the two wealth groups and 14 different age groups are statistically significantly different.\nNote that, in the anova table, the df (degrees of freedom column), tells you how many groups there are. df is the number of groups minus one. So, for WEALTH groups, df is 1, because there are two groups (high and low, which we created) and so df=2-1=1. For age, which gives participants’ birth month, there are df=13-1=12 groups, i.e. the number of months of the year.\nFinally, we are interested in finding how much of the variance is explained by age and wealth, so we can run an eta-squared test, and multiply by 100 to get percentage variance explained\n\neta<-etaSquared(resaov)\neta<-eta*100\neta\n\n              eta.sq eta.sq.part\nST004D01T 0.01017853  0.01031889\nWEALTH    0.85001629  0.85446249\nAGE       0.50555112  0.50996135\n\n\nWEALTH and AGE only explain a small amount of the variation, 0.85% and 0.5% respectively."

For example, if the anova reports statistically significant differences by age, statistically significant differences might exist between 11, 12 and 13-year old students, but not between 13 and 14-year olds.\nWe can use an additional anova test, Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference test (or Tukey’s HSD for short), to find out which pairs of subgroups have statistically significant differences in means.\nConsider the question: Are there statistically significant differences in the science scores of the UK, US, France and Germany?

    "text": "7.6 Task 5\nFinally, a significant open question is the extent to which discovery learning impacts students’ results. The PISA 2015 data contains a couple of variables related to whether students report their teachers use direct instruction (teacher-led activities) or not.\nFirst, download the PISA 2015 dataset: PISA_2015 and load the data using this code:\n\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#PISA_2015 <- read_parquet(\"<folder>PISA_2015_student_subset.parquet\")\n\nIn PISA 2015 there were a number of variables related to students’ reports of their teachers’ teaching styles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIBTEACH is a composite variable that quantifies teachers’ use of inquiry based teaching. It is based on responses to nine questions: frequency with which they experienced specific activities:\n\nstudents are given opportunities to explain their ideas;\nstudents spend time in the laboratory doing practical experiments;\nstudents are required to argue about science questions;\nstudents are asked to draw conclusions from an experiment they have conducted;\nthe teacher explains how a science idea can be applied to different phenomena;\nstudents are allowed to design their own experiments;\nthere is a class debate about investigations;\nthe teacher clearly explains the relevance of science concepts; and,\nstudents are asked to do an investigation to test ideas\n\n\n\nTDTEACH scores teachers use of teacher-directed approaches. It is based on 4 items on the survey asking the frequency of:\n\nThe teacher explains scientific ideas;\nA whole class discussion takes place with the teacher;\nThe teacher discusses our questions;\nand the teacher demonstrates an idea.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask: For science, determine the amount of variation in scores explained by IBTEACH and TDTEACH for the whole data set.

    "text": "8.1 PISA\n\n8.1.1 What is PISA\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an OECD initiative that looks at the reading, mathematics and science abilities of students aged 15 years old. Data is collected from ~38 OECD countries and other partner countries every three years.\n\n\nDataset\nDescription\n03\n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\n\n\n\nStudent\ndemographic data on student participants\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\n\nSchool\ndescriptive data about schools\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\n\nParent\na survey for student’s parents including information about home environments and parental education\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeacher\ndemographic, teaching, qualification and training data\n\n\n\nx\nx\nx\n\n\nCognitive\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\n\n\nPISA datasets above can be found on the OECD website. The links in the table above will allow you to download .rds versions of these files which we have created, though they might need additional editing, e.g. reducing the number of columns or changing the types of each column. If you want to find out more about what each field stores, take a look at the corresponding codebook, for example from 2018.\n\n8.1.2 How to use it\nThe PISA datasets come in SPSS or SAS formats. The data used in this course comes directly from downloading the SPSS .sav files and using the haven package to clean it into a native R format suitable for analysis, in most cases .parquet files (see: Section 2.8.6). There are a few quirks that you need to be aware of:\n\nR uses levels (factors) instead of labelled data\nAll SPSS fields are labelled, and auto conversion into the native R dataframe format would make numeric fields, factors(!?). To avoid this confusion we have stripped out the no-response data for numeric fields and replaced it with NA values. This means that you won’t be able to tell the reason that a field is missing, and the following labels have all been set to NA:\n\n\nLabels set to NA in .rds and .parquet files\n\nvalue\nlabel\n\n\n\n95\nValid Skip\n\n\n97\nNot Applicable\n\n\n98\nInvalid\n\n\n99\nNo Response\n\n\n\n\nAs the fields are now using R’s native factor format you might find that the data doesn’t quite match the format of the table labels. For example, CNT is labelled “Country code 3-character”, but the data is now instead the full country name.\nthe examples shown above use cut down PISA datasets, where only a limited number of columns are included.\n\n8.1.3 Common issues\nThe PISA datasets can be absolutely huge and might bring your computer to its knees; if you are using a computer with less than 16Gb of RAM you might not be able to load some tables at all. Tables such as the Cognitive dataset have hundreds of thousands of rows and thousands of columns, loading them directly might lead to an error similar to this: Error: cannot allocate vector of size 2.1 Gb. This means that R can’t find enough RAM to load the dataset and has given up. You can see a rough estimate of how much RAM R is currently using the top Environment panel:\n\nTo get around this issues you can try to clean your current R environment using the brush tool:\n\nThis will drop all the current dataframes, objects, functions and packages that you have loaded meaning you will have to reload packages such as library(tidyverse) and library(haven) before you can attempt to reload the PISA tables.\nA lack of RAM might also be the result of lots of other programs running concurrently on your computer. Try to close anything that you don’t need, web browsers can be particularly RAM hungry, so close them or as many tabs as you can.\nIf none of the above works, then please get in touch with the team, letting them know which table you need from which year, with which fields and for which countries. We will be able to provide you with a cutdown dataset.\n\n8.1.4 Questions\n\n8.1.4.1 What are Plausible Values?\nIn the PISA dataset, the outcomes of student tests are reported as plausible values, for example, in the variables of the science test (PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV3SCIE, and PV5SCIE). It might seem counter intuitive that there are five values for a score on a test.\nPlausible values (PVs) are a way of expressing the error in a measurement. The number of questions in the full PISA survey is very large, so students are randomly allocated to take a subset of questions (and even then, the test still takes two hours!). As no student completes the full set of questions, estimating how a student would have performed on the full question set involves some error. Plausible values are a way of expressing the uncertainty in the estimation of student scores.\nOne way of thinking of the PV scores is that they represent five different estimates of students’ abilities based on the questions they have answered. To decrease measurement error, five different approaches are applied to create five different estimates, the PV scores.\nThe PISA Data Analysis Manual suggests:\n\nPopulation statistics should be estimated using each plausible value separately. The reported population statistic is then the average of each plausible value statistic. For instance, if one is interested in the correlation coefficient between the social index and the reading performance in PISA, then five correlation coefficients should be computed and then averaged\nPlausible values should never be averaged at the student level, i.e. by computing in the dataset the mean of the five plausible values at the student level and then computing the statistic of interest once using that average PV value. Doing so would be equivalent to an EAP estimate, with a bias as described in the previous section.\n(p. 100) Monseur et al. (2009)\n\n\nWhat are PV Values - exclude non-OECD? as mean too low\ndifference between TA and NA for field names\n\n8.1.4.2 Why are some countries OECD countries and others aren’t?\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has 38 member states. PISA is run by the OECD and its member states normally take part in each PISA cycle, but other countries are allowed to take part as Partners. You can find more details on participation here.\nResults for OECD members are generally higher than for Partner countries:\n\nPISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(OECD) %>% \n  summarise(country_n = length(unique(CNT)),\n            math_mean = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            math_sd = sd(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            students_n = n())\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  OECD  country_n math_mean math_sd students_n\n  <fct>     <int>     <dbl>   <dbl>      <int>\n1 No           43      434.   106.      317477\n2 Yes          37      490.    93.8     294527\n\n\n\n8.1.4.3 Why are the PV grades pivoting around the ~500 mark?\n\n8.1.4.4 Why are the letters TA and NA used in some field names?\n\n8.1.4.5 How are students selected to take part in PISA?\nStudents are selected by … (ref?)\nAdd Christian Bokhove papers https://bokhove.net/r-materials/\nFrom the data, you can see that 50% of schools entered fewer than 30 students into PISA.\n\nPISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(CNTSCHID) %>%\n  summarise(size = n()) %>%\n  mutate(quartile = ntile(size, 4)) %>%\n  group_by(quartile) %>%\n  summarise(Qmax = max(size),\n            Qmedian = median(size),\n            Qmean = mean(size))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  quartile  Qmax Qmedian Qmean\n     <int> <int>   <dbl> <dbl>\n1        1    19       9  9.53\n2        2    29      25 24.6 \n3        3    35      33 32.8 \n4        4   491      40 44.9 \n\nggplot(PISA_2018 %>% \n  group_by(CNTSCHID) %>%\n  summarise(size = n()), aes(x=size)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Interesting papers and reading on PISA\nJerrim Jiang and McComas (2015) Monseur et al.

    "text": "9.1 Questions about R\nWhy doesn’t my select/filter statement work?\nWhen you are loading packages, sometimes different packages have the same function names in them, and the functions themselves will do very different things. For example, there is a select function in the tidyverse, but also another select function in the package MASS that does something very different. If we load the tidyverse before loading MASS, then the MASS version of select is the one that will be used?!\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\ndiamonds %>% select(carat, cut, color)\n\nTo get around this make sure that you load the tidyverse after MASS, in fact you should always load the tidyverse last.\n\nlibrary(MASS) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndiamonds %>% select(carat, cut, color)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 3\n   carat cut       color\n   <dbl> <ord>     <ord>\n 1  0.23 Ideal     E    \n 2  0.21 Premium   E    \n 3  0.23 Good      E    \n 4  0.29 Premium   I    \n 5  0.31 Good      J    \n 6  0.24 Very Good J    \n 7  0.24 Very Good I    \n 8  0.26 Very Good H    \n 9  0.22 Fair      E    \n10  0.23 Very Good H    \n# … with 53,930 more rows\n\n\nyou can also specify the package that select comes from (in this case from a package within the tidyverse called dplyr):\n\ndiamonds %>% dplyr::select(carat, cut, color)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 3\n   carat cut       color\n   <dbl> <ord>     <ord>\n 1  0.23 Ideal     E    \n 2  0.21 Premium   E    \n 3  0.23 Good      E    \n 4  0.29 Premium   I    \n 5  0.31 Good      J    \n 6  0.24 Very Good J    \n 7  0.24 Very Good I    \n 8  0.26 Very Good H    \n 9  0.22 Fair      E    \n10  0.23 Very Good H    \n# … with 53,930 more rows\n\n\nHow can I unload packages\nIf you are finding yourself with a conflict as mentioned above and want to unload packages, then you need to run the following code:\n\n# adapted from: @mmfrgmpds https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7505547/detach-all-packages-while-working-in-r\nwhile(!is.null(sessionInfo()$loadedOnly)){\n  lapply(names(sessionInfo()$loadedOnly), require, character.only = TRUE)\n  invisible(lapply(paste0('package:', names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs)), detach, character.only=TRUE, unload=TRUE, force=TRUE))    \n}\n\nWhy am I getting the error ‘could not find function “%>%”’\nThe pipe operator %>% is loaded when you load the tidyverse package - make sure you have installed tidyverse and loaded it\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")  # install\nlibrary(tidyverse)             # load\n\nI am getting the error: ‘“Error: Mapping should be created with aes() or aes_().”’ when using ggplot\nThis may be caused by having a bracket after the geom rather than before it\n\ndata<-data.frame(x=5:1,\n                 y=10:6)\nggplot(data, aes(x, y) +           # Reproduce error message\n         geom_point())\n\n\ndata<-data.frame(x=5:1,\n                 y=10:6)\nggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +           # Fixed error by moving bracket\n         geom_point()"
